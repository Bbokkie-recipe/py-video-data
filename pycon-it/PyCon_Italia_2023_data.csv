In this talk, I will be sharing about the power of representation and its ability to help us move beyond our present circumstances. 
When we see an athlete perform at the Olympic games, particularly if we can identify a part of ourselves in them, this experience is transcendent. We feel their pain when they lose, reflect their joy when they win, and in many ways, we imagine that we can do what they do! 


This presentation will reflect on how we can utilize these shared experiences to understand the significance of representation, especially for marginalized communities, in the world of technology today. 
I will share my own experiences as a Zimbabwean woman working in tech and how representation, and in many cases the lack thereof, has affected me and others.

16 months, 6 editors, 5 Python releases, 4 PSF Fellows, 3 time zones, 2 continents…, 1 book!

This talk covers the process of updating “Python in a Nutshell” to its 4th edition, addressing changes spanning 5 new releases of Python.
We discuss how we coordinated with each other, several official and unofficial reviewers, and our publisher’s staff, to create the book. 
(Hint: Google Spaces, Docs, and Spreadsheets, as well as Google Meets, were all invaluable.)

We address some of the challenges we met in slimming down this “coconut shell” of a book, not just by removing Python 2 material, but also by moving two chapters entirely online and removing coverage of certain areas which deserve books of their own.

We also share a few of the interesting and surprising Python features and corner cases that we discovered while working on the book (despite already being experts when we started).

Software engineering is more than just a technical skill. It is a way of thinking; a way of expressing our humanity, values, and identity. Over time, the sharpness of our skills increases, but the intensity and vibrance of our “passion” often dwindles. We’ll reflect on how fighting complacency to stay curious and take risks can help us re-invent our work and ourselves to discover what’s next.
