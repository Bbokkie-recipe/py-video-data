I will give an overview of what we learned from looking at Alpaca, LIMA, Dolly, UltraFeedback and Zephyr and how we applied that to fine-tuning a state-of-the-art open source LLM called Notus and Notux by becoming data-rich.\n\nDescription:\nGPUs are in high demand and low supply but being GPU-poor can be solved by focusing on data quality and becoming data-rich. By looking at efforts like Alpaca, LIMA, Dolly, UltraFeedback and Zephyr, we can see again and again that data quality is often a thing that does not get the attention it deserves. \r\n\r\n1) Alpaca was made up of synthetic data that was not representative of real-world usage. 2) LIMA standing for Less Is More Alignment showed that a high-quality curated preference dataset with only a fraction of the required data could outperform other datasets in alignment tasks. 3) Databricks employees seemed to misunderstand the annotation task at hand. 3) UltraFeedback showed synthetic data at scale was possible and that GPT4 could be used to curate data aligned with human judgement. 4) Zephyr was trained on UltraFeedback but overlooked a bug in the dataset. 5) We trained Notus by resolving this bug but overlooked the fact training data was present in the benchmarks. 6) We started distilabel and worked on Notux.\n\nLearn more: https://2024.pycon.it/event/from-gpu-poor-to-data-rich-data-quality-practices-for-llm-fine-tuning\n\n#MachineLearning #OpenSource #BestPractice #CaseStudy #NaturalLanguageProcessing",

This talk will drive the audience through the main ideas powering ChatGPT, to rip through the curtain of magic around the tool.\n\nDescription:\nChatGPT has become a groundbreaking tool, transforming how professionals in various industries work. However, while many articles focus on \"the 30 prompts everybody needs to know\", they often overlook the underlying technology of ChatGPT. \r\n\r\nTo truly understand ChatGPT, it's important to comprehend three key concepts:\r\n\r\n1. **Embeddings**: how Large Language Models (LLMs) convert words and phrases into numerical values, allowing them to interpret natural language effectively.\r\n2. **Transformers**: advanced deep-learning modules that enable LLMs to understand semantic connections within text, even when they're widely spaced.\r\n3. **RLHF (Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback)**: a technique to align AI models with our intended purposes and ethical standards.\r\n\r\nIn our presentation, we will explore the four primary steps involved in building and training a GPT-like model. In our journey, we will discuss Embeddings, Transformers, and RLHF, but we will not stop at the technical details. \r\n\r\nBy relying on the laters academic studies, we will also discuss both the limitations and strengths of current generative AI models and provide actionable insights to foster their safe and effective adoption.\n\nLearn more: https://2024.pycon.it/event/embeddings-transformers-rlhf-three-key-ideas-to-understand-chatgpt\n\n#Education #BestPractice #DeepLearning",

        "description": "Designing a Human-Friendly CLI for API-Driven Infrastructure - Oliver Rew - PyCon Italia 2024\n\nElevator Pitch:\nIn this talk, I will share our experience designing a CLI that dynamically updates itself based purely on API documentation, and describe some of the specific challenges and solutions to this problem.\n\nDescription:\nAs Bloomberg‚Äôs infrastructure grows and evolves, the tools we use to manage it are becoming increasingly important. To streamline infrastructure management, our team set out to design a REST API and constituent CLI (Command Line Interface) that would comprise a single interface for both programmatic and human interaction with our infrastructure. Traditionally, building a CLI that is tightly coupled to an API requires maintaining a separate codebase, which is tedious and error-prone. Instead, we designed a CLI that dynamically generates commands based on the OpenAPI JSON documentation. However, since APIs are designed for computer interaction, we designed our API to include the information needed to implement a human-friendly CLI. Leveraging Python, FastAPI, and numerous other open source projects, we built a stable, extensible tool that greatly improves how we interact with our infrastructure.\n\nLearn more: https://2024.pycon.it/event/designing-a-human-friendly-cli-for-api-driven-infrastructure\n\n#Documentation #APIs #FastAPI #Starlette",

        "description": "Code More, Draw Less, and Debug Just a Little! - Yash Saboo - PyCon Italia 2024\n\nElevator Pitch:\nUnderstanding software architecture and data flow is vital when building any maintainable system and debugging the errors. While we are searching for life on Mars, our architectural diagrams and debugging tools remain manual and lifeless. Let's use GraphDB, pandas, and Python to add life to them.\n\nDescription:\nBefore I dive into how to draw less and debug just a little, let's recap your life as an engineer, which likely looks like one of the following:\n\n- You often wonder before you go to sleep, \"A short time ago in a galaxy not that far, far away, I updated my software's architecture diagram. So why is it stale‚Ä¶ again?\"\n- Your team grew in size during the pandemic and so did your components and ownership. Has it become harder to onboard new engineers due to ever-changing software, dependencies, and owners?\n- Your new release didn't go as planned because something broke in your new code. Wouldn‚Äôt it help if you had a holistic and interactive view to navigate between software components while understanding how they communicate with each other? When was the last time you used your architectural diagram as a debugging tool?\n- You managed to quickly draw the data-flow diagram to help with debugging your system and you thought ‚Äúthis is majestic work right here!‚Äù But the feedback you received was, \"it‚Äôs too detailed\" or \"it‚Äôs not detailed enough.\" While you‚Äôre trying to figure out the fine line between too many and too few details, your hairline is starting to show!\n\nIf you‚Äôve fallen victim to any of these scenarios, behold! Your prayers have been answered!\n\nIn the first half of this talk, we‚Äôll describe an approach that can automatically identify the software design and data flows within your systems. To achieve this, we use algorithmic scrapers and metadata profiling techniques that integrate with distributed trace, code structure, language dependencies, contribution ownerships, and other sources to avoid the toil of manually updating software architecture diagrams and debugging tools.\n\nIn the second part of this talk, we will dive deeper into the details of how to use Python data engineering libraries to enrich the collected data and process it for storage in a graph database. The graph structure not only signifies the relationships between components in a real-world manner, but also helps in generating multiple views of the software architecture in an easy and comprehensible fashion. Now, instead of the architecture and data flow diagram being a static JPEG, those auto-generative views can be compiled into interactive and immersive UIs for debugging.\n\nMy team built a debugging visualization tool for our organization, Bloomberg, but the approach we took is germane to all tech organizations. We want to share the challenges and lessons we learned during our journey to help you build a similar tool for your organization because why not ‚ÄúCode More, Draw Less, and Debug Just a Little‚Äù?!\n\nLearn more: https://2024.pycon.it/event/code-more-draw-less-and-debug-just-a-little\n\n#Visualization #Pandas #Tooling #Architecture #GraphDatabases",

        "description": "Enhancing AsyncIO for Complex Applications - Anton Caceres - PyCon Italia 2024\n\nElevator Pitch:\nDealing with AsyncIO can get tricky, especially in bigger projects. In our talk, we'll dive into making AsyncIO work smoother for you. Expect real tips on managing multiple connections, smarter task handling,  and cracking those tough debugging problems.\n\nDescription:\nWe all love AsyncIO. Yet as our project's complexity scales up, we might find ourselves struggling with debugging, managing a surge of connections, and the art of asynchronous task management. This talk is your roadmap to navigating these challenges.\n\nWe'll start by tackling one of the most daunting aspects of AsyncIO: debugging. If you've ever felt like you're chasing ghosts in your code, this is for you. We'll introduce you to effective strategies and tools tailored for AsyncIO, transforming debugging into a manageable routine.\n\nNext, we address scaling issues. When your application grows, so does the number of connections and tasks it must handle. I'll guide you through optimizing your AsyncIO application to handle this growth efficiently, sharing practical advice to prevent common performance pitfalls.\n\nIntegration is another key area we'll explore. How does AsyncIO fit with other Python libraries and frameworks you're using? We'll dive into examples that show how to make AsyncIO work in harmony with your entire Python stack, enhancing its functionality and your productivity.\n\nAs a desert, we'll take a walk over real-world scenarios where these strategies have been successfully applied. These case studies will illustrate how the right approach to AsyncIO can significantly improve the performance and scalability of complex Python applications.\n\nBy the end of this talk, attendees will be equipped with a deeper understanding and new techniques to use the full potential of AsyncIO in large-scale projects.\n\nLearn more: https://2024.pycon.it/event/enhancing-asyncio-for-complex-applications\n\n#AsyncIO #Performance #Architecture #Debugging",

        "description": "Analyzing COVID-19 Protest Movements: A Multidimensional Approach Using Geo-Social Media Data - Nefta Kanilmaz - PyCon Italia 2024\n\nElevator Pitch:\nThe spread of conspiracy theories on social media through protest movements is a societal problem. For effective countermeasures, understanding the movement's spatial manifestation is essential. This talk explores how leveraging a geo-social network analysis of Twitter data can address the issue.\n\nDescription:\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and associated policy measures lead to world-wide protest movements that were singled out by the spread of misinformation and conspiracy theories, predominantly on social media platforms. Publicly available social media data therefore is a powerful proxy for studying these protest movements. The data, consisting of user locations, follower relationships, and content information, allows to understand the geographical centers of activity, network structure, and key themes of conspiracy movements.\r\n\r\nThis talk will present a multi-dimensional network analysis for the Austrian COVID-10 protest movement using Python libraries like geopandas, networkx and gensim. In particular, it will demonstrate how to identify geo-spatial hot spots using spatial statistics, densely connected clusters within the network by employing community detection techniques, as well as dominating content themes through topic modeling approaches.\r\n\r\nThe presentation highlights how data-driven analysis enables further understanding of movements that may pose threats to democracy, alongside the importance of publicly available social media data for addressing societal challenges.\n\nLearn more: https://2024.pycon.it/event/analyzing-covid-19-protest-movements-a-multidimensional-approach-using-geo-social-media-data\n\n#Analytics #Visualization #CaseStudy #GEOandGIS #NaturalLanguageProcessing",

But that's not the case when you have to handle a lot of requests on a large scale. So how do you reduce memory consumption without affecting the CPU?\nWant to know more? So let's talk about PEP 683, GIL and memory management\n\nDescription:\nIn this presentation I'll discuss memory management in Python from the basics, where the necessity for PEP 683 came from, and the changes introduced by it. I also intend to discuss why this PEP is so important for the language, and what we'll be able to achieve with it in the future, such as changes to the GIL and true parallelism.\n\nOutline:\n* 2 min self-presentation;\n* 3 mins: memory management in python from the basics;\n* 3 mins: memory, GIL and threads;\n* 5 mins: Motivation and use case: why immutability and ignoring reference count?;\n* 3 mins: problems ahead! Backwards/platform compatibility, performance degradation;\n* 5 mins: future implications and where immortal objects are already being used (other related PEPs);\n* 2 mins for conclusions and thanks;\n* 5 mins for Q&A;\n\nThe talk is targeted for folks who are intermediate/advanced pythonistas. People who are just starting with Python (maybe less than 1.5 years) may feel a bit lost. Even so, curious learners are more than welcome to join, and will try my best to make it as easy as possible for all audiences on this topic.\nAfter this presentation, participants will learn a bit more about how memory management works under the hood in python, and how it may change in the next couple of years.\n\nLearn more: https://2024.pycon.it/event/pep-683-immortal-objects-a-new-approach-for-memory-managing\n\n#OpenSource #CPython",

        "description": "The European AI Act: a data scientist‚Äôs perspective - Luca Gilli - PyCon Italia 2024\n\nElevator Pitch:\nThe new EU's AI Act mandates assessments for high-risk AI, with a focus on robustness and human oversight. This talk explores these requirements, discussing how they can be implemented as part of a ML pipeline, and presents a Python-based case study guiding data scientists on the new regulations.\n\nDescription:\nAfter years of discussions and negotiations, in December 2023,  the European Council and the European Parliament agreed on shaping the first rules in the work to govern AI- aka, the AI Act. In the coming months, the proposed draft, which adopts a risk-based approach to AI governance, is set to become a law enforced across the EU member states, with far-reaching global effects. In tangible terms, violations would cost companies between ‚Ç¨7.5-‚Ç¨35 million or 1.5%-7% of their global turnover, based on the risk level of the AI applications. The current text states that high-risk AI systems must undergo a conformity assessment based on extensive technical documentation before being used in production. The contents of the required technical documentation are defined at a very high level and will need to cover aspects such as accuracy, robustness, and human oversight of AI systems. This talk will analyse the requirements of an AI system's technical documentation from a data scientist's perspective. In particular, we will first tackle the technical aspects that must be verified to consider an AI system as conforming. For example, we will discuss human oversight from a technical point of view, highlighting different interpretability techniques that can be used to perform this analysis. We will then show a practical example of technical documentation related to an illustrative machine learning model from a financial use case. This use case will demonstrate how to translate most of the requirements included in the technical documentation into machine learning model tests implemented using open-source Python libraries. By the end of the talk, participants will have a practical understanding of what the new regulation means from the perspective of a data scientist developing new machine learning-based systems.\n\nLearn more: https://2024.pycon.it/event/the-european-ai-act-a-data-scientists-perspective\n\n#MachineLearning #BestPractice",

We'll explore GraphQL vs RESTful APIs, tackle the N+1 problem, and unveil Strawberry's Django integration for efficient queries. Learn to build high-performance, type-safe APIs with ease üòä\n\nDescription:\nIn this talk, we will explore the world of GraphQL APIs with Strawberry, a new Python library that makes it easy to create GraphQL APIs with Django. We will dive into what GraphQL is, how it compares to traditional RESTful APIs, and what makes Strawberry stand out from other Python GraphQL libraries.\n\nOne of the biggest challenges in GraphQL API development is the N+1 problem, where queries can become exponentially slow as more data is requested. We will discuss how data loaders can help solve this problem, and go in-depth on how to use them in Strawberry. In this topic we will also cover how the Strawberry Django integration leverages query introspection and user defined hints to automatically call .only(‚Ä¶)/.select_related(‚Ä¶)/.prefetch_related(‚Ä¶) on querysets, making your queries more efficient and avoiding common pitfalls. This is especially important in high-traffic, production environments where performance is critical.\n\nFinally, we will showcase some of the benefits of using Strawberry and Django together, including a type-safe approach to API development and streamlined code maintenance. By the end of this talk, you‚Äôll have the knowledge and tools you need to create high-performance GraphQL APIs with Strawberry and Django.\n\nIt will be presented in the following order:\n* Intro\n* Quick overview of what a GraphQL API looks like and its advantages\n* Writing general GraphQL APIs using Strawberry\n* Integrating the Django ORM with Strawberry\n* Some common pitfalls, with emphasis on the N+1 problem\n* GraphQL tools to avoid those pitfalls and how to use them with Strawberry\n* How the Strawberry Django integration uses introspection to automatically overcome those pitfalls and also improve performance when executing Django querysets\n\nLearn more: https://2024.pycon.it/event/building-high-performance-type-safe-graphql-apis-with-strawberry-and-django\n\n#AsyncIO #Django #GraphQL #APIs #Performance",

But in practice development of cloud-native Python applications has a different character. Debugging from another side is also complex. Sometimes, I spend most of the time on debugging rather than development. \nThere are many different books and official docs, but there‚Äôs not enough information on debugging your programs efficiently, especially in cloud environments or inside Kubernetes. \nLuckily, we have a couple of options to consider when debugging cloud-native applications in Python.\nIn my talk, I'll show different techniques to debug containerized applications, including remote debugging, how to debug still, even if we're using multi-staged docker builds, how to debug applications already deployed without any debuggers, also how to attach for running Python processes inside the container. In the end, we‚Äôll discuss tips and tricks on troubleshooting things like permissions, networking, and other k8s failures that may affect your applications.\n\nLearn more: https://2024.pycon.it/event/debugging-python-applications-inside-k8s-environment\n\n#Docker #Debugging",

We will cover how to identify individual farmer fields, assess soil conditions, give farming recommendations, and combat deforestation.\n\nDescription:\nOne Acre Fund is a non-profit organization helping smallholder farmers in Africa. We provide millions of farmers in 10 countries with practical support like quality seeds, fertilizers, market access and training. Our approach is hands-on, focusing on increasing farm productivity and promoting sustainable practices. Through our work, we aim to break the cycle of poverty for these farmers and contribute to food security in their communities.\n\nDuring this presentation, I will focus on the geospatial aspect of my job as a Data Scientist. I will share my experiences in utilizing satellite imagery through Google Earth Engine, a free platform that provides petabytes of geospatial up-to-date data and powerful analysis capabilities. The focus will be on how we've employed Python, unlocking information about farmers' fields.\n\nThe first part of the talk will showcase the process of accessing satellite information from Google Earth Engine. We'll explore how to extract valuable insights, including soil composition, rainfall patterns, and temperature variations, all crucial factors in optimizing agronomic decisions.\n\nThen I will show how we worked together with Berkeley and MIT to delineate fields accurately, by using a Residual U-Net (ResUNet), a deep learning architecture tailored for semantic segmentation. This step is key in identifying individual farmers' plots, which makes future analysis possible.\n\nAfter that, I will demonstrate how we leverage this geospatial data to recommend optimal planting dates and maize types based on specific soil characteristics, temperature profiles, and rainfall patterns (both historical and real-time). I will show how we use Machine Learning for this and how we avail the results through API endpoints.\n\nThe final part of the talk will feature a Streamlit app that visually represents all the geospatial information gathered. This interactive tool not only aids in data exploration but also serves as a model for how developers and data scientists can craft user-friendly interfaces to communicate complex agricultural insights effectively. I will show how our end users in the field use the tool to check for deforestation, which is important for the reliability of their carbon credit projects.\n\nThroughout the presentation, the emphasis will be on open-source python packages like geemap, sklearn, streamlit and pytorch. Attendees will gain practical insights into replicating and customizing these methodologies for their specific applications. In the end, I hope the attendees learned how to use Google Earth Engine, API endpoints and Streamlit to work with geospatial data. And of course, this presentation will give insights into what it is like to be a Data Scientist working for an African NGO.\n\nLearn more: https://2024.pycon.it/event/from-pixels-to-plots-transforming-lives-of-african-smallholder-farmers-through-geospatial-data\n\n#Visualization #BigData #MachineLearning #DeepLearning #GEOandGIS",

We'll dive into the practicalities of integrating Django's synchronous ORM with FastAPI's asynchronous capabilities.\n\nDescription:\nDjango is the most extensive Python framework, which is also very opinionated and synchronous. In contrast, FastAPI emerges as a more recent, asynchronous framework.\n\nAs a developer and the maintainer of several services, one of which is a data visualization tool deployed in production across various companies, I have had the unique opportunity to use Django ORM with FastAPI. If you take a look through GitHub or other resources, you'll notice there's not much out there about combining Django and FastAPI ‚Äî it's a bit of an unconventional setup. The aim of my talk is to share insights from my experience with this setup, highlighting its practical implementation and the lessons learned along the way.\n\nThis talk is aimed at programmers from beginners to more experienced ones familiar with either of these frameworks. You'll gain insights into combining asynchronous frameworks with synchronous ones, along with understanding the benefits and challenges of this approach.\n\nLearn more: https://2024.pycon.it/event/combining-django-orm-and-fastapi-in-a-data-visualization-tool\n\n#Django #APIs #FastAPI",

But after learning to use it correctly, it became my favourite new feature in Python. In this talk, we will learn how to use match to write much nicer, pythonic code. Then you will also fall in love with match.\n\nDescription:\nWhen 'match' statement was added to Python 3.10, I thought it was a confusing feature. I thought that it was just a fancy way of doing if/then/else statements. Why do we need a new feature just to make if/then/else a little simpler?\n\nBut I found out that my understanding was wrong. It is not a way to do if/then/else. It is something called structural pattern matching. That was a complicated word for me, but after reading up, the concept is not so difficult. It quickly became my favourite new feature in Python.\n\nIn this talk, we will take a deeper understanding into structural pattern matching and how it is related to match statement. With that understanding, we will learn how to use 'match' effectively. We will also look at some practical day to day situations where 'match' statement makes the python code much cleaner and easy to read.\n\nBy the end, you will understand why this feature was added into Python, how to use it effectively and fall in love with 'match' just like I did.\n\nLearn more: https://2024.pycon.it/event/supercharge-your-code-with-pythons-match-statement\n\n#CPython #FunctionalProgramming #CleanCode",

While exploring its versatility, simplicity, and extensive community support, let's code a healthier world in healthcare and battle online villains with Python, our ethical superhero! #PythonForGood\n\nDescription:\nLet‚Äôs zoom out for a moment and have a look at the vast canvas of our world, at the challenges it presents to us. Now, imagine if Python could be the color that paints a brighter future within that canvas. In this talk, let‚Äôs embark on a **purposeful journey** with Python: a journey where a bunch of lines of code works as a catalyst for positive transformation.\r\n\r\nPython for its **simplicity**, **versatility**, and most importantly, its **community support**, has constantly been the first choice. For starters, libraries like *Numpy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn*, and *OpenCV* have played pivotal roles in the research and development of revolutionary solutions. But this isn't just about coding; it's about applying Python to make a tangible impact on people's lives. In this talk, we will introduce two such domains, which we have been involved working in over the last few years\r\n\r\nFirst, we‚Äôll delve into Python's role in **healthcare and medical research**, where code becomes a savior. Imagine writing code that identifies diseases, automates healthcare processes, and contributes to a healthier world.\r\n\r\nBut that‚Äôs just the start. Python isn't just a coding language; it's like a superhero on a mission for good. Imagine Python as the hero **fighting online bad stuff** ‚Äì like bullies, mean talkers, and fake/misleading news. And what‚Äôs more? It has some cool sidekicks, like *Huggingface, EthicalML*, and *TensorFlow-Fairness-Indicators*, making it a real ethical superhero in the coding world.\n\nLearn more: https://2024.pycon.it/event/lets-make-the-world-a-better-place-python-for-social-good\n\n#DeepLearning #CaseStudy #NaturalLanguageProcessing",

Join us as we discuss the common pitfalls and the tools we can use to address them, and together we can make python as common as the viper.\n\nDescription:\nIn the 2023 Datadog State of Serverless Report, researchers identified python as the #2 most used language for AWS Lambda, with nearly 30% of lambda functions using python [1]. Additionally, python has the shortest cold start time out of all languages [1], was the first supported language for Lambda Powertools, and event has its own specific local testing tools, python-lambda-local and the moto mocking library. With all this support, it‚Äôs surprising to see how difficult python can still be in cloud development. Working for years in Serverless DevOps and Cloud Enablement in a large enterprise, as well as engaging with the tech community, I‚Äôve seen beginner developers up through seasoned architects struggle with packaging python dependencies in the cloud, get frustrated with frequent build & deploy failures, and fall into the ‚Äúwell it works locally on my machine‚Äù trap. Luckily, with some expertise and the supporting technologies we have at our disposal, these difficulties can be not only easy to work through but will have you reaching for python for all your cloud applications.\n\nDETAILED OVERVIEW\nAs an avid python AWS lambda developer, we will spend this session focusing on the common pitfalls of python AWS lambda development, the tools & techniques we can use to overcome these challenges, and how to get the most out of developing your AWS lambda functions with python.\n\nThis talk will cover:\n‚Ä¢ The challenges developers face working with python compute in AWS, including dependency conflicts & package sizing, working with local vs deployed environments, interacting with the filesystem & the OS library, injecting environment variables, and more.\n‚Ä¢ Tips & tools for addressing your Big Python Problems in cloud, including embracing technologies like Docker & containerization, lambda layers, and lambda powertools.\n‚Ä¢ Testing appropriately with python-lambda-local, moto, and tox to save time & future frustrations.\n\nAttendees will walk away with an understanding of how to create, develop, and troubleshoot pesky python AWS lambda functions following best practices from real-world experiences.\n\nAUDIENCE\nThis session is best suited for those at any level in their career, however this session may be of particular interest to those that have intermediate experience with python & AWS or focus on cloud computing with python. This is a technical topic focused python AWS Lambda development that would be extraordinarily beneficial for anyone looking to develop or strengthen their serverless cloud computing posture.\n\nSOURCES\n[1] https://www.datadoghq.com/state-of-serverless/#:~:text=Python%20and%20Node.,js.\n\nLearn more: https://2024.pycon.it/event/snakes-and-ladders-the-ups-and-downs-of-python-development-with-aws-lambda\n\n#Packaging #BestPractice #AWS #Testing #Computing",

Misunderstanding this aspect of Python may lead to *suboptimal architectural choices*. I invite you to see my attempt at explaining the GIL and its implications, as well as providing pointers for **how to deal with the GIL** in specific situations.\n\nThere have been (and still are), of course, attempts to get around the GIL - or *get rid of it* altogether. I hope to give some light to these works.\n\nBy providing a comprehensive overview of today's GIL in CPython, this presentation aims to help make **better design choices** - be it choosing a concurrency/parallelism model, Python implementation to use - or even whether or not to drop. Python entirely.\n\nLearn more: https://2024.pycon.it/event/gil-whats-the-hassle-and-should-i-care\n\n#AsyncIO #Performance #CPython #MultiProcessing #MultiThreading",

Need to filter, sort, pivot, and aggregate static/streaming data in realtime? Daunted by the massive JS ecosystem? In this talk, we'll build a high performance web frontend using the open source library Perspective. \n\nDescription:\nThe Python ecosystem has ample supply of both web development frameworks, and data visualization components. But despite the maturity of the ecosystem, few datavisualization tools are capable of dealing with large amounts of streaming data. Even fewer are able to perform live aggregations, sorting, and filtering on top of this data.\n\nIn this talk, we will put together a simple but full-featured website using [Perspective](https://perspective.finos.org). Perspective is an open source interactive analytics and data visualization component, which is especially well-suited for large and/or streaming datasets. It is written in C++ and Rust with bindings to both Python and WebAssembly, making it ideal for data-intensive applications. It comes with a variety of visualization plugins, including a datagrid and various charts. Additionally, it comes with a Jupyter widget, which allows developers to iterate quickly with a clear pathway to their production website.\n\nWe will start with a simple [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com)-based website and some static data. In a few lines of code, we will have the website up and running. Next, we will demonstrate some of the core features of Perspective - pivoting, sorting, filtering, the various visualization plugins, cross-filtering (using one table as a filter on other tables), and computed columns. After this, we will pull in some streaming data and show how the functionality of Perspective demonstrated updates in realtime alongside the data. Finally, we'll crank the speed of updates to the limit.\n\nBy the end of this talk, the audience will know how to use Perspective and how to incorporate it into their own applications for both static and streaming data, either as a simple but high performance datagrid or as a full featured set of interconnected visualization components.\n\nLearn more: https://2024.pycon.it/event/high-performance-data-visualization-for-the-web\n\n#Analytics #Visualization #FastAPI",

Learn about performance improvements, our takeaways, and how to harness Rust's power in your next Python project!\n\nDescription:\nRewriting libraries in Rust is a hot topic in the Python community. But how do you maximize performance gains, and what‚Äôs the best way to shift parts of your Python codebase to Rust? We tackled these questions while working on Strawberry-GraphQL, one of the largest Python-based GraphQL frameworks, and performance is key for the large companies that rely on us.\n\nWe saw parsing and validation performance increase by up to seven times with our implementation. Plus, we've got more work planned to further enhance performance and share our tools with other language frameworks.\n\nHowever, it wasn't straightforward. One main challenge was integrating Rust with our existing code in the execution engine. Rust's complexities initially made it seem unwise to move parts of our codebase into Rust, but we developed effective strategies for successful integration.\n\nThis session is great for you if you're interested in gaining performance with Rust or exploring the internals of a GraphQL execution engine. Prior GraphQL knowledge isn't necessary, but a basic understanding will help.\n\nJoin Erik to learn more about improving Python performance with Rust, and how you can implement Rust-based modules in your projects!\n\nLearn more: https://2024.pycon.it/event/rewrite-everything-in-rust-what-we-learned-from-introducing-rust-in-strawberry-graphql\n\n#GraphQL #Performance #Rust",

        "description": "Nim for Pythonistas - Pietro Peterlongo - PyCon Italia 2024\n\nElevator Pitch:\nWhat if I could tell you that there is a language that looks like Python but achieves the performance of C? And that also has the power of metaprogramming of Lisp? Nim is a statically typed compiled language that does all the above and more. And it is easy to learn for Pythonistas.\n\nDescription:\nExperienced Pythonistas are used to reach out to an alternative language when in need for higher performance. In the past this meant to reach out for C, C++ or Cython, more recently the trend is towards Rust. Nim is a relatively unexplored option as a language to learn as a second (or third or ...) language on top of Python, but it does provide some interesting benefits.\nAs Rust, Nim is a statically typed and compiled programming language that can be use to boost Python's performance. But Nim has different tradeoffs, in particular less emphasis on memory safety and a much easier learning curve, thanks to a indentation based syntax very much familiar to Python developers. \n\nIn this talk we will give a brief presentation of Nim language particularly tailored to Pythonistas. We will cover the language from the ground up, making frequent remarks to the differences with Python. We will briefly cover metaprogramming, one of the most powerful parts of Nim. We will try to convert the philosophy of the language (the Zen of Nim) and we will also cover the part of the ecosystem that are relevant for interoperability with Python (nimpy, nimporter, ...).\nWe will also cover one of the most interesting aspects of Nim that represents a rather distinctive selling point: Nim can compile to Javascript and allows us to be able to work with frontend technologies directly.\n\nAt the end we will briefly cover Nimib, my open source project recently ported also to Python. This will showcase a way to use metaprogramming in a real project and how to create a Python package using Nim.\n\nThe goal of this talk is to make you curious to go and try out Nim (come for the performance, stay for the ergonomics!), but even if you just come out with a better appreciation and understanding of Python we would still be happy.\n\nLearn more: https://2024.pycon.it/event/nim-for-pythonistas\n\n#Performance #JavaScript",

        "description": "Importing Without \"import\": Behind the Scenes of importlib - Bryce Beagle  - PyCon Italia 2024\n\nElevator Pitch:\nYou've typed `import x` or `from y import z` in your Python programs countless times. But you probably don't know what really goes on behind the scenes. When are import statements actually evaluated? How does Python know where to find packages? What does importing a package even do at runtime? \n\nDescription:\nThe import system of Python is frequently used, but seldom fully understood. It's a black box of mysterious behavior‚Äísymbols magically become available in your file, but how? This talk will go over the inner workings of `importlib`, the internal library responsible for all things importing.\n\nYou may be familiar with `sys.path` or even the `site-packages` directory, but have you heard of `finder`s, `loader`s, or `spec`s? We'll also discuss the `__import__` builtin, how to import packages without using the import statement, package and module lookup, caching, and more.\n\nThis talk will be a fast-paced crash course/demo as we tinker with the internals of the import process. We'll have a little fun along the way by messing with the internal library to break things in strange ways. We'll also do the dumb thing of building PyO3 bindings for a Rust library _at import time_, just to show that we can.\n\nThis talk is targeted towards an intermediate to advanced audience. An understanding of how to (normally) import packages is required, and being knowledgeable of system packages such as `sys` is beneficial. After this talk listeners should come away with a deeper understanding of what the language is doing every time the import statement is used.\n\n\nLearn more: https://2024.pycon.it/event/importing-without-import-behind-the-scenes-of-importlib\n\n#APIs #Packaging #CompilerandInterpreters",

Since that realization the AI field has pursued ever larger models, trained at ‚Äúeye-watering‚Äù cost. If scaling is all you need ‚Äì does it follow that, in practice, money is all you need?\n\nIn this talk we explore ideas for the rest of us, the GPU-poor. Taking examples from language processing and computer vision, we‚Äôll show you how to make do with less ‚Äì less computing power, less person power, less data ‚Äì while still building powerful models. We will introduce a set of methods and open source tools for the efficient reuse and miniaturization of models, including transfer learning and fine-tuning, knowledge distillation, and model quantization. We will also discuss how to choose efficient model architectures, and investigate ways in which small and specialized models can outperform large models. Our talk aims to provide an overview for ML practitioners, draws from our combined project experience, and is accompanied by a repository of code examples to get you started with building AI on a microbudget.\n\nLearn more: https://2024.pycon.it/event/ai-on-a-microbudget-methods-of-machine-learning-miniaturization\n\n#MachineLearning #OpenSource #DeepLearning #NaturalLanguageProcessing #Algorithms",

        "description": "Demystifying Oauth2 Authorization framework - Jorge Martinez Gomez - PyCon Italia 2024\n\nElevator Pitch:\nNowadays, Most applications have incorporated the Login with Facebook or Google button. This makes easy for users not to remember all the password for every platform. In this talk I will show you how this works internally and enable it within your future apps.\n\nDescription:\nOauth, and more specifically Oauth2, are enjoying interest as a result of increased popularity in a wide range of common web application. By providing authorization by users, for example, people can now send their CV to other services using linkedin information previously written on their profile. However, the source of the methodology and limitations of oauth remain poorly understood. With this talk, I aim to bridge the gap by providing an analysis involved with this protocol, using simple examples. Moreover, common jargon will be explained using the pre-defined oauth terms. Finally, a comparative analysis between Oauth and OpenID will supply insights to attendees to be used on their future applications.\n\nWith the wide adoption of collaborative platforms and social networks, many developers have had the opportunity to connect users with their data wherever they are on the web. Oauth provides the ability for different applications to access user‚Äôs data securely without requiring the user to take the scary step of handing over an account password. In other words, Oauth is a security protocol which allows users to grant delegate access of their web resources to third-party applications without sharing credentials.\n\nSince its inception (and after certain revisions), many companies have adopted this protocol, such as Yahoo, Facebook or Google. Many users authorize applications to perform actions on their behalf. Nevertheless, the permission is scoped at a certain level. For instance, people can login and use the Spotify application using Facebook credentials. Spotify can read the user‚Äôs facebook profile, but it cannot read tagged photos.\n\nCurrently, many developers made use of the oauth2 authorization protocol with the purpose of avoiding the implementation of the app‚Äôs own login page. The ease of setting the required tokens and credentials to grant users access of the application using third-party databases, reduces the amount of time of developing and launching an app into production. In addition, relying on a third-party login application, lessens generated bugs within the application, such as database connection, security leaks, among others. However, the source of the methodology, terminology and implementation of Oauth2 remains poorly understood. This raises concerns of the lack of interpretability and limits our ability to design better architectures, or even, implementing the application own‚Äôs authorization server using oauth2.\n\nBecause of this, I made this proposal to bring to the attendees fully understanding of the oauth2 authorization framework in plain English (or spanish). The talk will provide a solid overview and be accessible to a target audience not already familiar with the Oauth and provide a much more detailed understanding of the framework. Digging more specifically into the authorization code flow, where I will explain each stage of the protocol and introducing important key terms within the relevant terminology.\n\nThe schedule of the talk will be the following:\n- Definition of Oauth2 (5 min)\n- Brief history of oauth (5 min)\n- The oauth2 authorization framework protocol flow (15 min)\n- Difference between authorization and authentication. Talk about OpenID connect (5 min)\n- Question and answers (10 min)\n\nLearn more: https://2024.pycon.it/event/demystifying-oauth2-authorization-framework\n\n#APIs #Authentication",

        "description": "A Retrieval Augmented Generation system to query the scikit-learn documentation - Lemaitre Guillaume - PyCon Italia 2024\n\nElevator Pitch:\nRubber ducks are used for many years to help Pythonistas in their everyday quest. At scikit-learn, we've elevated ducky to another level: come and meet the scikit-learn Ragger Duck, a RAG system designed to answer all your scikit-learn questions ‚Äì at least as effectively as a duck can.\n\nDescription:\nCurrently, the scikit-learn website provides an \"exact\" search engine based on the tools provided by the Sphinx Python package (i.e., https://www.sphinx-doc.org/). The current search engine is implemented in JavaScript and runs locally using an index built when generating the documentation. This solution has the advantage of being lightweight and does not require any server to handle the query. However, the complexity of the query treated is weak: since the search is \"exact,\" it is not robust to spelling mistakes, and the search is intended for searches based on keywords.\n\nAs large language models (LLMs) are becoming more popular, we have been interested in experimenting with this technology, knowing that they could address some of the previously stated limitations. As an open-source project, we have limited resources in terms of compute and limited available datasets; therefore, we discarded the option of fine-tuning an LLM and leaned towards retrieval augmented generation (RAG) systems.\n\nThis talk presents an experimental RAG system developed to query the scikit-learn documentation. As constraints, we impose ourselves to use an open-source software stack and open-weight models to build our system. The talk is decomposed as follows:\n\nFirst, we provide some background on the RAG system and the pipeline to follow to implement such a system.\n\nThen, we go into details in the different stages of the RAG pipeline. We provide some insights regarding documentation scraping strategies that we developed by leveraging the `numpydoc` and `sphinx-gallery` parser. Then, we discuss the solution that we tested to perform lexical and semantic searches. Finally, we explain how the context found can be fed to the LLM to help generate an answer to the user query. We provide a small demo to compare queries performed on an LLM-only system and on the developed RAG system. All the code for the experiment is hosted at the following GitHub repository: https://github.com/glemaitre/sklearn-ragger-duck.\n\nFinally, we put into perspective the gains and pains of such an RAG system when it comes to integrating it into an open-source project. Notably, we question the hosting and cost of such systems and compare it with other approaches that could tackle some of the original issues.\n\nLearn more: https://2024.pycon.it/event/a-retrieval-augmented-generation-system-to-query-the-scikit-learn-documentation\n\n#MachineLearning #Documentation #OpenSource",

        "description": "RAGtime with Haystack! How to build a RAG with Haystack 2.0?  - Tommaso Radicioni - PyCon Italia 2024\n\nElevator Pitch:\nIs your LLM hallucinating too? Let's build together a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) algorithm with Haystack 2.0! We will explore the basic concepts and a practical example to delve into one of the most interesting developments in the field of automatic text generation.\n\nDescription:\nRetrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) represents a significant step in improving the generative capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Indeed, RAG is an innovative paradigm that is based on the integration of two crucial components: the extraction of relevant information from a knowledge base and the ability of a generative model to reframe this information into a coherent text. In the first stage, a search model, or Retriever, is used to index and extract fragments of text. These fragments are then provided to an LLM, which uses this information base to provide relevant and accurate answers.\n\nThe power of this approach allows an LLM to limit incorrect or misleading information, thereby reducing hallucinations, i.e., the tendency of generative models to produce false information supported by seemingly solid reasoning. While the internal knowledge of an LLM is extensive, it is necessarily generic or limited because of the slowness and cost of training. The use of an external knowledge base provides a more accurate guide to text generation, overall improving the reliability and consistency of the generated responses.\n\nAfter an introduction on the basic concepts behind the RAG, the purpose of the presentation is to build a RAG through the use of Haystack, an open-source framework widely used in Natural Language Processing (NLP). Haystack has many features that make it an optimal choice for implementing a RAG, such as flexible document management, the ability to index heterogeneous data, and ease of integration with recent LLMs.\n\nAs of August 2023, Haystack has released a version still under development of a major update that will lead to the release of Haystack 2.0 or v2. During the presentation, we will see how new logic in building Pipelines for text retrieval and generation makes Haystack an even more robust tool for LLM-based applications.\n\nThrough a practical example, it will be shown how to implement a RAG with Haystack's methods and functions and what changes in the new v2 version. Pipeline architecture and configuration choices will be examined to understand how to translate the theoretical concepts exposed in the first part of the presentation into an efficient and reproducible scheme. The presentation will conclude with a discussion of the performance and limitations of RAG when put into production within a software product.\n\nLearn more: https://2024.pycon.it/event/ragtime-with-haystack-how-to-build-a-rag-with-haystack-20\n\n#BigData #NaturalLanguageProcessing",

Metteremo in discussione le nostre convinzioni, capiremo l'arte e la scienza dietro il codice cercando di stimolare un dialogo sull'impatto significativo delle nostre decisioni.\n\nDescription:\nUna riflessione stimolante sull'influenza della filosofia nel mondo della programmazione.\nSpesso considerata una mera attivit√† ingegneristica, la programmazione √® in realt√† un campo in continua evoluzione, dove si intersecano tecnica e pensiero critico.\nIn questa presentazione, esploreremo il percorso evolutivo della programmazione - imperativa, ad oggetti, funzionale - fino alle moderne frontiere con i Large Language Models (LLM) e l'Intelligenza Artificiale, dove il codice stesso sembra sfumare nell'ombra.\n\nAffronteremo anche importanti questioni etiche: il significato e l'importanza dell'open source, ma anche l'usabilit√† e l'accessibilit√† del software. Queste riflessioni sono fondamentali per comprendere come le nostre scelte di programmazione influenzino direttamente l'esperienza dell'utente finale (e il mondo?).\n\nQuesto talk √® pensato per essere accessibile a tutti: dal neofita appassionato di tecnologia al programmatore senior in cerca di nuove ispirazioni.\nL'obiettivo √® offrire una prospettiva fresca e approfondita su come la filosofia e la programmazione si intrecciano, portando a una comprensione pi√π ricca di quello che facciamo. √à un invito a esplorare non solo come scriviamo il codice, ma perch√© lo scriviamo in un certo modo.\n\nLearn more: https://2024.pycon.it/event/oltre-il-codice-che-ruolo-ha-la-filosofia-nella-programmazione\n\n#OpenSource #Education #BestPractice #Science",

What if we have no control over the training data? What if there is no defined test set? What if we do not have ground truth? What if...\n\nDescription:\nIn this talk we will explore complex real world situations in which a model may be deployed. We will examine some common real world scenarios that make Data Science considerably more complex than the training/test split we often encounter in tutorials; we will analyse Python libraries and techniques that will allow us to estimate how the model is performing in the real world, when we may not have true labels, or when only a subset of errors are found, or when the problem is ill defined and we need to implement an approximate solution.\n\nLearn more: https://2024.pycon.it/event/i-have-no-clue-what-my-model-is-doing\n\n#Pandas #MachineLearning #Science",

In this talk I will show the situations in which abstract base classes helped me to resolve some apparently unrealistic challenges.\n\nDescription:\nSometimes it happens, when you have to add a feature to your package, to facing difficult challenges. Often in these cases apparently the choice seems to be restricted between having an inefficient implementation or an enhancement of a base library. This can be true particularly in Python, which has many optimized modules implemented in C, but sometimes these modules are not fully compliant or efficient for what you have to develop.\r\n\r\nHere comes to help you the abstract base classes, that can be used to create simple handling objects that wrap a not trivial implementation. In this talk I'll show some concrete cases of apparently difficult to solve limitations that were solved with the usage of Abstract Base Classes and their advantages over completely custom implementations.\r\n\r\nThe Abstract Base Classes have the option of register virtual subclasses  and this can be very useful when you have to implement a hierarchy of types without reinventing the wheel and reusing a mix of custom types and built-in datatypes.\n\nLearn more: https://2024.pycon.it/event/abstract-tricks-how-abstract-base-classes-can-help-you-to-solve-difficult-challenges\n\n#Performance #DataStructures",

This historic application data is hugely valuable, and you can use data analytics to glean all sorts of business insights from it. \n\nHowever, if your database and code are optimised for your day-to-day application (OLTP) activity, they might not be optimised for analytics (OLAP). You'll typically be running more complex queries, joining data from multiple tables, and working on large data sets. \n\nHow can you do this efficiently and make sure you don't slow down your application?

        "description": "How you can write a dataframe-agnostic library - Marco Gorelli - PyCon Italia 2024\n\nElevator Pitch:\nIf you're writing a library which consumes dataframes, should you choose to support pandas, Polars, cuDF, modin, vaex, pyspark, dask, or something else?\n\nDon't choose - learn how the DataFrame Interchange Protocol and/or Narwhals enable you support them all!\n\nDescription:\nIn 2023, we saw several libraries - which had previously only supported pandas - add support for other dataframe libraries such as Polars, Modin, and cuDF. They typically did this by keeping their existing code, and converting non-pandas inputs to pandas. They've usually been smart about only converting the parts of the dataframe which they need, but nonetheless, this approach has limitations.\n\nDownsides of the \"just convert to pandas\" approach are:\n- it requires users who otherwise weren't using pandas to have an extra, non-lightweight dependency\n- transferring data between GPU and CPU can be expensive\n- the pandas API is very flexible, and sometimes overly so, meaning that anyone developing on top of it may end up with code less robust than would be ideal\n\nThis talk will introduce you to the DataFrame Interchange Protocol and to Narwhals, which allow library developers to:\n- support multiple dataframe libraries with just a single API\n- minimise, or even eliminate, conversion costs\n- use a strict, minimal API for maximal robustness\n\nThe format will roughly be:\n\n- 2-3 mins: an overview of the dataframe landscape\n- 2-3 mins: what happened in 2023, which libraries started supporting Polars instead of just pandas\n- 5 mins: what are the limitations of just converting to pandas?\n- 5 mins: what's the Dataframe Interchange Protocol?\n- 7-8 mins: how can you use Narwhals to support multiple dataframes? How can get Narwhals to support your dataframe library?\n- 2-3 mins: what comes next\n- Q&A / awkward silence\n\nBy the end of the talk, attendees will have learned about the dataframe ecosystem, and those involved with dataframe-consuming libraries will know all they need in order to effectively support multiple dataframe libraries.\nLibrary maintainers and contributors will get the most out of the talk, but anyone regularly using dataframes will also learn a lot about the tools they use.\n\nLearn more: https://2024.pycon.it/event/how-you-can-write-a-dataframe-agnostic-library\n\n#Pandas #APIs #Abstractions",

Eventually the typists gave us `typing.Protocol`. Using it is key to write well annotated Pythonic code.\n\nDescription:\nMany Pythonistas, this author included, reacted in shock and disbelief to the introduction of type hints in Python 3.5. We knew that duck typing was essential to idiomatic Python, but type hints did not support it until Python 3.8, with *PEP 544 ‚Äì Protocols: Structural subtyping (static duck typing)* and the `typing.Protocol` special class.\n\nStatic duck typing, first popularized in the Go programming language, allows programmers to leverage the essential idea that \"if it quacks like a duck then it is a duck\", when quacking behavior is required. In other words, it does not matter whether a class has the proper \"ancestry\" or DNA, as long as it implements the interface to play a role. With interfaces defined as `typing.Protocol`, the type checker can verify that an object's class implements the required methods.\n\nLearn more: https://2024.pycon.it/event/pythonic-type-hints-with-typingprotocol\n\n#BestPractice #TypeHinting",

        "description": "Ten Years of Community Organizer - Alexander Hendorf - PyCon Italia 2024\n\nElevator Pitch:\nA joyful journey through a decade in the üêç Python community! In this talk, I'll share my experiences of 10 years community events. We'll explore the magic of organizing, the art of leadership, and the impact of Python on personal and professional growth. Let's learn, laugh, and lead together! ü§óüöÄ\n\nDescription:\nAs a community organizer, I have had the privilege of being a part of the Python community for the past ten years.\nIn that time, I have seen the community grow and evolve in countless ways. Python evolved from a top 10 language to the top 1 language. Many new people joined the community, new topics as data & AI became part of Python. I'm super proud the preferred language to learn is Python nowadays.\n\nI have also learned a great deal about what it takes to be an effective organizer and how to build and sustain a healthy community. I also experience how not to do it and pulling through in hard times.\nI learned a lot about leadership. I learned a lot about myself, my strength and my weaknesses.This helped me also to grow professionally and had a very positive impact on how I work and lead in my day-job.\n\nIn this talk I will address:\n\n**Experiences** made organising community conferences small and large.\n\n**Leadership**: sharing insights when teams worked well or not. What are the ingredients for a good community team.\n\n**Ideas, motivation and complexity**: All are driving factors for building enjoyable community conferences. Is more always better? When to say YES or sorry, but no.\n\nHow to **deal with the boring stuff**, admin, tax and legal.\n\n**Outlook**: What the European Python Community should work on for a sustainable future. The community has grown - individuals lack time. We need a strategy to keep up our excellent community work for beginners and experts while facing structural obstacles as admin, processes, reinventing the wheel. In this part I want to present why I did join the EuroPython board again. Helping to make the future mission of EuroPython Society evolving into more than being a conference to a European umbrella for the community.\n\nMy community service \"CV\":\n* 2013 local MongoDBB meetup\n* 2014 joined EuroPython\n* 2015-2020 core EuroPython organizer, 2 years board member\n* 2017 -2018 PyCon DE organizer\n*  2018 - today EuroSciPy organizer\n* 2018 - today PyData S√ºdwest meetup organizer\n* 2019-2022 PyCon DE & PyData Berlin chair\n* 2019 - today Python Software Verband chair (German Python association)\n* 2023 PyCon DE & PyData Berlin organizer\n* 2023 EuroPython board member\n\nIn this talk I will share the most valuable lessons I have learned and best practices over the past decade, with the goal of helping others who are interested in organizing and contributing to the Python community.\n\n### The first section\n will focus on the importance of community organizing in the Python community. I will discuss the role that organizers play in building and sustaining a healthy community, and the benefits that organizers and community members alike can reap from effective organizing.\n\n* Definition of how Python conf work \n* Outside references\n* Amazing magic\n* What do organizers actually do?\n* What is needed to be done\n* Organizers are dedicated\n* Organizations that provide platforms for Orga/conf - NumFocus and Pioneers Hub\n\n### The second section \nwill explore the challenges and opportunities of organizing in the Python community. I will discuss some of the unique challenges that organizers face in the Python community, such as the diversity of the ecosystem and the rapid pace of change, and the opportunities that organizers have to make a real impact and create lasting change.\n* Decentral\n* Workload\n* Admin\n* Processes\n* Pop up company style\n* Too many ideas\n* Managing ppl\n* Project management\n* Very agile\n\n### The third section \nwill focus on the specific skills and practices that are necessary for effective organizing in the Python community. I will cover topics such as building and leading teams, community engagement, and creating and executing on a strategic plan.\n* Ppl skills \n* You can learn you just need to learn to listen to criticism \n* Community is helpful but not necessarily reliable long term, it‚Äòs voluntary \n* Many levels of contribution\n* Documentation and briefings structure\n\n### The final section \nwill look to the future, and discuss some of the directions that the Python community can take in the next ten years in terms of organizing. I will suggest some specific areas of focus, such as increasing diversity and inclusivity, and highlight some of the emerging trends and technologies that organizers should be aware of.\n\n* Professionalizing \n* Governance \n* Platforms for organizers \n* Chaos and non cordination drives ppl out\n* Staff/Setup not worthwhile for individual conferences \n\nLearn more: https://2024.pycon.it/event/ten-years-of-community-organizer\n\n#Community",

        "description": "Quit Simplifying! - Florian Haas - PyCon Italia 2024\n\nElevator Pitch:\nIn this talk, I explain the concepts of complexity and entropy, and how they derail the idea of simplification. I delve into why it is that people, even if they have pure intentions and a great desire to simplify, usually end up doing the opposite. And I give suggestions on what to do about that.\n\nDescription:\nIn my 20+ years of working with open source software, I have seen lots of things go from simple to advanced to complicated, to then be replaced by something ostensibly radically simpler ‚Äî which itself then predictably landed on the exact same path of ever-increasing complexity.\n\nI have seen this in three different projects up close, of all of which I have been a heavy user and occasional contributor: Ansible, OpenStack, and Open¬†edX. It just so happens that all these are Python codebases but that does not reflect negatively on Python, and it does not reflect negatively on those projects, their founders, or their developers either: the growth in complexity in software projects is a given. It is not the problem. The problem is that we think we can avoid it.\n\nNow that I am a manager, I see much the same patterns: organizations seek to simplify their architecture, their deployments, even their organizational structure ever further, only to end up with more complex, more complicated, more Byzantine solutions than they ever had before. Managers, who should make it their goal to curb and slow the growth of complexity in their part of the organization, are frequently complexity accelerators, making things needlessly more complicated for everyone.\n\nAnd even top-level decision-makers, with their quest of distilling everything down to a small number of \"simple\" metrics on which they can base long-term planning, end up building edifices built on entropic quicksand.\n\nIn this talk I highlight the core issue of ever-increasing complexity in non-trivial systems, and the fact that is as inexorable as the passage of time. I identify the special kind of hubris (or well-meaning ignorance) it takes to assume you can wind the clock backwards. And I explain how every one of us can identify things acting as complexity multipliers and people acting as complexity accelerators, and what to do about them.\n\nLearn more: https://2024.pycon.it/event/quit-simplifying\n\n#Education #DistributedSystems #Architecture #Abstractions #DevOps",

However, these updates often require changing the database schema with migrations. In this talk, we will discuss a solution that allows the software to remain life and able to handle incoming traffic while performing migrations.\n\nTo ensure zero downtime during this process, the old code must be compatible with the new database schema. Although this may seem easy, it often isn't. In this talk, we will cover problematic operations such as:\n\n- renaming tables or columns,\n- deleting tables or columns,\n- adding new columns,\n- updating all records in a table with a large amount of data.\n\nWe will discuss potential problems that may arise due to certain changes and provide corresponding solutions. Additionally, I will describe the challenges we encountered when introducing this approach to Saleor, an open-source e-commerce platform powered by Django.\n\nWhile the topic and examples are from the Django project, the issue is general and can be faced by any database-related project.\n\nThe structure of the talk:\n\n1. Background of the problem\n2. Examples of operations causing the downtime\n3. Introducing the zero-downtime strategy\n    1. Writing migrations that follow a zero downtime approach\n    2.

This is done for good reasons as it's the only way to ensure that clients won't have problems when installing the package. Or, at least, it *used* to be the only way.\n\nBundling binary blobs into packages also comes with some downsides, the biggest of which is that, of the current 66TB of package data stored in PyPI, 50TB (75%) is just binary blobs (see https://py-code.org/stats), which is only going to get worse as the rise of new architectures will mean that even more pre-built blobs will have to be bundled in each package.\n\nIn this talk I will explain why building C/C++ projects can be problematic and will show how those problems are solved by the Zig compiler toolchain. After that I will explain the exciting things that could be achieved once building C/C++ code stops being a problem, from helping PyPI free some space, to creating maximally efficient builds for the target machine.\n\nBy the end of the talk attendees should have gained some insight into how Python tooling interacts with C/C++ dependencies, have gained some sympathy for PyPI (running a package index is expensive!), and be inspired by the positive effects that advances in the systems programming space can bring to Python.\n\nLearn more: https://2024.pycon.it/event/deinventing-the-wheel\n\n#Tooling #Packaging #Performance #PyPi",

In questo talk verr√† descritto come viene sfruttato Qdrant per gestire le memorie di Cheshire Cat, framework open source di A.I. per Retrieval-Augmented Generation e molto altro. Vieni a scoprire come non perderti nel Vector Space!\n\nDescription:\nAd oggi l'hype maggiore nel mondo della A.I. ce l'hanno sicuramente i LLM, ogni settimana c'√® un modello che supera tutti nei benchmark e nascono nuovi framework ma per sfruttare al massimo la potenza di questi giganti non ci si pu√≤ limitare alla loro conoscenza intrinseca, bisogna liberarli e per far ci√≤ esiste la RAG. Al centro di questa rivoluzione ci sono in VectorDB che fanno da memoria alle applicazioni, mettendo a disposizione i \"ricordi\" (documenti, conversazioni, ...). All'interno di queste applicazioni il ruolo del VectorDB √® quello di una enorme biblioteca, dove vengono immagazzinati vettori, in questo spazio il retriever fa da bibliotecario consigliando al LLM le risorse che con pi√π probabilit√† lo aiuteranno a darci una risposta.\n\nCheshire Cat √® una di queste applicazioni, √® open source, italiana, e usa come VectorDB Qdrant, anch'esso open source, per gestire le sue memorie. Qdrant viene utilizzato per:\n\n- gestire tre memorie differenti: una per le conversazioni, una per i documenti e una per i tools\n- viene usato in deverse versioni in-memory Qdrant per il testing, file-based per lo sviluppo, container-based in produzione\n- gestire la dimensione dello spazio vettoriale al cambio di embedder\n-  just in time backups grazie agli snapshots\n\nIn questo talk verranno descritte le sfide che la gestione di un prodotto cos√¨ complesso comporta quando si parla di VectorDB e di come sono state risolte anche grazie alle funzionalit√† messe a disposizione da Qdrant.\n\nNon mancheranno anche alcune novit√† ad arricchire il talk visto che gli sviluppi sono in corso in questo momento, insomma saranno 30 minuti utilissimi per non perdersi nel Vector Space!\n\nLearn more: https://2024.pycon.it/event/dont-get-lost-in-vector-space\n\n#MachineLearning #Databases #NaturalLanguageProcessing #Algorithms",

Introspection, descriptors, and `__init_subclass__` are going to be our friends.\n\nDescription:\nIn other words, Descriptors + PEP-362 (function signature object) and a seasoning of PEP-487 (simpler customization of class creation via `__init_subclass__`).\n\nThere are different ways to have generated methods and attributes attached to all classes in a library, and this talk presents the way we‚Äôre doing it in scikit-learn. Here you‚Äôll understand the use-case, and see the details and challenges presented by it, and how we approached them.\n\nThis talk uses tools in the Python language which seem like black magic at first to most, but understanding them gives you very strong tools you can use in your daily work to customize your objects the way you need.\n\nThe use-case we study here goes as: we would like to add methods to all `Estimator`s, which are all subclasses of the `BaseEstimator`. The signature of the methods generated depends on the signature of other methods existing in those subclasses, but we also want to give the option of modifying generated methods without having to change the existing methods.\n\nThe solution we present involves a few concepts which we‚Äôll explain during the talk:\nInvestigate the existing methods‚Äô signature using `inspect`\nManually traverse MRO (method resolution order) and inspect class attributes allowing for modifications on what the `inspect` has concluded\nUse a descriptor to generate methods accordingly\nUse PEP-362 to attach a signature object to the generated methods\nDynamically generate docstrings for those methods\nUse PEP-487, aka `__init_subclass__`, to attach those methods to child classes when appropriate\n\nThis is a hands-on talk, explaining each concept in isolation and then showing how they fit \ntogether, and we‚Äôll be presenting and testing code during the talk.

        "description": "Pandas, Polars and the DataFrame Consortium. - Alessandro Romano - PyCon Italia 2024\n\nElevator Pitch:\nPandas transformed data manipulation, becoming essential for Data Scientists. It inspired similar tools, like Polars in Rust, each introducing unique DataFrames. This growth highlights the need for standardization, prompting the creation of a data consortium.\n\nDescription:\nPandas, a library in Python, has revolutionized the way we approach data manipulation and analysis, becoming an indispensable tool for Data Scientists worldwide. Initially created as a modest project, it has grown exponentially in functionality and popularity, forming the backbone of countless data science projects.\r\n\r\nThe success of Pandas has not gone unnoticed in the world of data science and programming. It has inspired a wave of similar tools and libraries, each aimed at refining, enhancing, or even revolutionizing how we work with data. These tools have introduced new functionalities, optimized existing processes, and addressed specific needs in various business contexts.\r\n\r\nOne of the most notable examples is Polars, developed in Rust. Polars is not just another data manipulation library; it's a testament to the evolving landscape of data science tools. Rust, known for its performance and safety, lends Polars an edge in handling large datasets more efficiently. This has allowed Polars to offer solutions to some of the challenges it took Pandas years to overcome, such as handling larger datasets with lower memory footprints and faster processing times.\r\n\r\nPolars, however, is just one of many examples. The data science community has seen an expansion of libraries, each introducing their own DataFrame implementations. From Dask, which extends Pandas' capabilities for larger-than-memory computations, to Vaex, which excels in out-of-core dataframes for massive datasets, each library has its unique proposition.\r\n\r\nThis burgeoning of diverse libraries, while beneficial, has also introduced certain challenges. The primary concern is the lack of standardization across these tools. Each library, with its unique approach and implementation, can lead to fragmentation in practices and methodologies in data science. This fragmentation can hinder collaborative efforts, create compatibility issues, and slow down the progress in the field.\r\n\r\nRecognizing these challenges, the data community has taken a significant step by establishing a data consortium. This consortium aims to guide developers and users through this diverse and rapidly changing landscape. Its objectives include the establishment of standards and best practices, promoting interoperability among different tools, and ensuring that advancements in the field are accessible and beneficial to a broader range of users.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the consortium also focuses on fostering a collaborative environment. By bringing together developers of various tools, it aims to harmonize efforts, reduce redundant work, and encourage the sharing of ideas and innovations. This collective approach is crucial in a field as dynamic and impactful as data science.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, while Pandas remains a cornerstone in data manipulation, the emergence of various other tools like Polars signifies a broader and more diverse ecosystem. This diversity, while presenting challenges in standardization and compatibility, also drives innovation and specialization, catering to a wider range of needs in the data science community. The establishment of the data consortium is a pivotal step towards harnessing this diversity, promoting collaboration, and guiding the future development of data manipulation tools.\n\nLearn more: https://2024.pycon.it/event/pandas-polars-and-the-dataframe-consortium\n\n#Pandas #DataStructures",

        "description": "The attentive programmer - Daniele Procida - PyCon Italia 2024\n\nDescription:\n\"I photograph to find out what something will look like photographed\", said the great photographer Garry Winogrand. The genius of his work lies in his phenomenal powers of attention, his ability to see. Seeing is a deliberate act.\r\nWhat do programmers \"see\"? How well do we do it? And are we so full of intention that we fail to pay attention?\r\nI want to pursue this question, with the aid of philosophers, poets and photography, and I want to light up a potential dimension in programming that I haven't seen explored. For example: why is it that a story or photograph can be about something, but we never hear of a computer program that is about something? Is it not possible? Or have we just missed it? We're all familiar with love poems and love songs - could a love program exist? What would it look like?\r\nI think we can answer all those questions in interesting ways, that connect our understanding and appreciation of the world and our arts with programming. I think that they can suggest new opportunities and ideas to us. And, I think that it can make a difference to us, even as practically-minded programmers doing practical work.\n\nLearn more: https://2024.pycon.it/event/the-attentive-programmer",

Isn't it a shame we can't use both in the same program?\n\nIt turns out we can! Learn how, with the help of some clever libraries, we can write compiled Python modules in Rust.\n\nDescription:\nIn this talk, you'll learn how to get started with using Rust directly from Python.\n\nWe'll start by introducing Rust itself. It's a very different language to Python with a whole new way of thinking. Along the way, we'll meet Cargo, Rust's excellent package manager.\n\nThen we'll see how we can plumb Rust code into Python as a native extension module, and distribute it as a wheel. We'll do this using Py03 and Maturin.\n\nYou don't need to know anything about Rust, extension modules or packaging - this will give you the fundamentals. By the end, you will know how to get started putting the power of Rust inside your Python programs.\n\nLearn more: https://2024.pycon.it/event/crabs-in-snakes\n\n#Rust",

        "description": "Acknowledging Women‚Äôs Contributions in the Python Community Through Podcast - Cheuk Ho - PyCon Italia 2024\n\nElevator Pitch:\nDisheartened by the lack of representation by women on Python podcasts, we decided to start a podcast with a goal to highlight their voices so that they could receive the recognition they deserve. In this talk, learn about about our podcast series and what we have achieved.\n\nDescription:\nThe Python community has been making efforts in improving the diversity and representation among its members. There are examples of success stories such as PyCon US Charlas, PyLadies, Djangonaut, and Django Girls. Yet in the Python podcast community, women are still underrepresented, making up only 17% of invited guests among the popular podcast series. Being a guest in a podcast is a privilege, and an opportunity to influence the Python community. There are many women and underrepresented group members who have made impactful contributions to the Python community globally, and they deserve the recognition and to be heard by the rest of us. Disheartened by the lack of representation by women on Python podcasts, and inspired by others who have shown us how diversity in the community can be improved through intentionality, we decided to start a podcast with a goal to highlight their voices so that they could receive the recognition they deserve. In this talk,earn about them, and about our podcast series. We‚Äôll also share how you can further help out cause in improving representation and diversity in the Python community. \n\n## Goal\n\nTo raise awareness of the underrepresentation of certain groups, especially women. To acknowledge the progress made by the Python community and what can be done further to continue the improvement.\n\n## Target Audience \n\nAnyone who cares about the diversity and inclusion progression in the Python community. Community leaders who want to be allies.\n\n## Outline\n\n### Diversity in Python community, examples (5 minutes)\n\n- PyCon US speakers: from 1% in 2011 to 40% in 2016\n-Efforts in improving diversity in the Python community: Charlas, PyLadies, DjangoGirls, Djangonaut\n\n### How are those efforts successful? (5 minutes)\n\n- Intentionality: starts with recognizing the issue and clear intention and goal in improving the situation\n- Outreach: targeted and direct outreach to underrepresented, explicit invitation asking underrepresented group members to participate in\n- Opportunity: providing opportunities and tools for women to succeed\n\n### In Podcast (3 minutes)\n\n- Since there were no stats, we collected our own data by scraping three most popular Python Podcasts\nCollected using Python, beautiful soup, and Datasette\n- Our result shows that among the three podcasts that have been running for years, women made up only 17% of invited guests, whereas there were the same men who appeared more frequently on the same shows\n\n### Why is ithis important (5 minutes)\n\n- Podcast guest is influential\n- Women and underrepresented group members deserve to be seen and heard\n- Representation creates inspirations. Lack of representation = lost opportunity to inspire women to further participate in the community\n\n### 6 months of our podcasts (4 minutes)\n\n- Share public reactions and support from our launch\n- Karolina Ladino: in Colombia, women has to be accompanied by husband, brothers to come to meetups, otherwise it's not safe for them to come alone. \n- Joanna Jablonski: making impact in Python community through documentation and developer education\n\n### How you can help(3 minutes)\n\n- Listen to their stories\n- Actively promote and boost voices from women and underrepresented group members\n- Suggest people to interview\n\nLearn more: https://2024.pycon.it/event/acknowledging-womens-contributions-in-the-python-community-through-podcast\n\n#Community #ConferencesandMeetUps #Diversity",

Un talk sull'IA e la privacy dei dati!\n\nDescription:\nNell'era digitale, dove la tecnologia permea ogni aspetto della nostra vita quotidiana, emerge in maniera cruciale la necessit√† di preservare le Informazioni Personali Identificabili (PII) per garantire la sicurezza e la tutela della privacy individuale.\r\n\r\nL'ampio utilizzo dell'Intelligenza Artificiale (IA) e del Machine Learning (ML) introduce sfide sempre pi√π complesse, soprattutto nei settori critici come quello sanitario, assicurativo e bancario. La pratica di impiegare dati sensibili per addestrare modelli di ML solleva notevoli interrogativi e rischi relativi alla privacy.\r\n\r\nPer affrontare con successo tali rischi e agevolare un addestramento sicuro dei modelli di ML, √® fondamentale adottare strategie avanzate, tra cui l'utilizzo dei dati sintetici. Questi dati, generati attraverso modelli di Intelligenza Artificiale Generativa, sono in grado di replicare fedelmente le stesse statistiche dei dati originali, consentendo l'addestramento dei modelli di ML senza compromettere la privacy individuale.\r\n\r\nCon l'obiettivo di proteggere la riservatezza delle informazioni personali contenute nei dati strutturati, abbiamo sviluppato Nerpii, una libreria open source in Python. Questo strumento esegue la Named Entity Recognition sui dati strutturati, individuando e successivamente generando informazioni personali sintetiche.\r\n\r\nIl talk proposto esplorer√†, inizialmente, l'importanza di proteggere le PII, mettendo in luce i rischi associati al loro utilizzo in contesti di addestramento di modelli di ML. Successivamente, verr√† presentata la libreria open source Python, Nerpii, per individuare e generare in modo sintetico le informazioni personali contenute nei dati strutturati.\n\nLearn more: https://2024.pycon.it/event/preservare-la-privacy-dei-dati-personali-nellera-dellia-un-approccio-pratico-con-nerpii\n\n#Privacy #NaturalLanguageProcessing",

        "description": "Mirror, mirror: LLMs and the illusion of humanity - Jodie Burchell - PyCon Italia 2024\n\nDescription:\nLarge language models (LLMs) exploded into mainstream awareness in 2022, and have continued to fascinate us since. But what is it about LLMs, compared to other, similarly complex algorithms, that have so captured our imagination? And why is it that we are so ready to believe that these models have started to show signs of human behavior? In this talk, we‚Äôll delve into some of the more extraordinary claims that have been made about LLMs in the past few years, including that these models are showing signs of sentience or intelligence. We‚Äôll discuss why humans have a tendency to see such traits in these models, due to the way they mirror back a ‚Äúlossy compression‚Äù of our humanity. And we‚Äôll talk about how dispelling myths about LLMs being anything more than language models can help us apply them to their best current uses.\n\nLearn more: https://2024.pycon.it/event/mirror-mirror-llms-and-the-illusion-of-humanity",

        "description": "Self hosting your side projects with Django and duct tape - An≈æe Peƒçar - PyCon Italia 2024\n\nElevator Pitch:\nYou can self-host multiple side projects using nothing but an old Raspberry Pi, your home wifi, Django, and actual duct tape. I'll show how to get around dynamic IP performance bottlenecks and achieve over three nines of uptime while handling thousands of daily requests on a budget of 0‚Ç¨ per month.\n\nDescription:\nThe talk will cover everything you need to know to host your projects on your hardware the old-fashioned way confidently. We won't use containers, virtualization, edge computing, or anything the cool kids use these days. Instead, we will rely on good old technology like Nginx and server-side rendered Django. We'll even have the database running on the same machine as if it's still the year 2009.\n\nEven though the deployment will be old-fashioned, the way we deploy new code changes won't be, as I'll show how to leverage GitHub Actions to get the latest Python code changes to your site every time you push to the main branch. I'll also talk about how to configure observability tools and be alerted if there is an issue. \n\nWe'll also cover some of the common gotchas, like buying the right SD card for your Raspberry Pi, dealing with your internet provider's dynamic IP addresses, compiling the latest version of Python, configuring your Nginx to run Django, configuring Postgres and dealing with backups. I'll even show you how to use duct tape to improve your site's uptime!\n\nI'll make the case that any developer comfortable running Python on their laptop can be comfortable running a Python web application connected to the internet.\n\nLearn more: https://2024.pycon.it/event/self-hosting-your-side-projects-with-django-and-duct-tape\n\n#Django #RaspberryPI #Infrastructure #DeploymentContinuousIntegration",
