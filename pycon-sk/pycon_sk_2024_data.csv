2,Pyments: How To Design Payment Applications In Python - Alvaro Duran,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2o4RgvXcYVw,2o4RgvXcYVw,PyCon SK,@pyconsk,https://www.youtube.com/@pyconsk,20240405,1932,282,6,,,Science & Technology,"Payments are a massive part of how the world works. But most engineers know very little about it.

That’s sad, because, as more and more of business happens online, there’s an increasing demand for payment applications that are scalable, and maintainable.

Besides, Python is a great programming language to build payment applications!

It is very interoperable, has a thriving open source community, and even non-engineers can contribute significantly to software built with it. In payments, readability counts, too!

In this talk, we’re going to dive deep into how to build money software effectively. You’ll learn why Python and payments are a match made in heaven, and how to leverage the language to build your own payment applications, in-house, fast, and effectively.

That way, you’ll cut some intermediaries in the process, saving your company a lot of money. It is no wonder why software engineers that can build payment applications are in high demand, they can point to their code and say “that prints money”.

The outline of the talk is:
Shut Up And Take My Money - Python is the Perfect Payments Language (5min)
Data-classes, Composition and A Chain of Responsibility (5-10min)
Unification, and the Anti-corruption Layer (5min)
Hand over Fist - Debugging Payment Applications (5min)
Outro - Every Company is a Payments Company (5min)

Even though you are on the same operating system, use the same application version, and all dependencies are pinned? Are some C-headers missing? Maybe you need to install some system package. Oh, and do you have the same version of the system package? Okay, let's hope we have wheels for this module. Oh no, we are building Alpine docker image, which uses musl libc instead of glibc, so no luck with wheels this time. We better include GCC. And also this and that one. What's the name of the OpenSSL for Alpine? Does it include the c headers? Great! Done! Now, let's do this dance one more time—this time in CI.

Úvodná časť poskytne prehľad o veľkých dátach, ich význame a výzvach, a prečo je Python považovaný za jeden z najvhodnejších jazykov pre ich analýzu. Budeme sa venovať kľúčovým knižniciam ako Pandas, NumPy, Polars, Dask, Modin a Vaex, ktoré sú nevyhnutné pre efektívne spracovanie dát.

Ďalšie sekcie sa budú zaoberať pokročilými témami ako distribuované spracovanie dát s využitím nástrojov ako Apache Spark, a integráciou Pythonu s inými platformami pre lepšiu škálovateľnosť a efektivitu. Významnú časť prednášky tvorí aplikácia Pythonu v oblasti strojového učenia a analýzy dát s praktickými ukážkami z rôznych oblastí.

Prednáška tiež poukáže na najlepšie praktiky pri práci s veľkými dátami v Pythonu, ako aj na špecifické výzvy spojené so spracovaním veľkých objemov dát v reálnom čase, zabezpečením dát, a škálovateľnosťou. Na záver sa dotkneme najnovších trendov a budúceho vývoja v oblasti veľkých dát a Pythonu, čím poskytneme účastníkom prednášky ucelený pohľad na súčasný a budúci stav technológií spojených s veľkými dátami.

Key Points of the Talk:

* Token Economy Across Languages: An analysis of which languages require the most tokens to express the same content. This segment will dive into the tokenization process of LLMs and compare major languages on their token consumption for equivalent texts.

* Cross-Lingual Embeddings Effectiveness: Evaluating how effectively LLMs' embeddings capture and express information across different languages. This part will focus on the quality of embeddings in bridging language gaps and maintaining semantic integrity.

* Reasoning Abilities in Various Languages: Investigating the reasoning capabilities of LLMs when operating in multiple languages. The focus will be on comparing the models' performance across a spectrum of languages.

Boot camps and certification programs of dramatically varying quality have emerged in nearly every corner of the world. These programs are often accompanied by lofty claims and promises. Children have been no exception to this, as more and more companies attempt to capitalize on the claim that children should start learning early because it's ""like learning a language"". However, research suggests that this might not be the most solid argument. What benefits are there in teaching them early? How do children acquire programming knowledge? How does our language around the concepts affect their understanding? Can the answer to these questions inform how we teach adults coming in from non-STEM fields?

We don’t have to worry about pre-allocating memory for our objects, or remember to free it once we’re done. So, given that we’re not doing it manually, how do these things happen? Do we have to care? Well, sometimes. Maybe.

We’ll also cover the id of an object, why it's implemented the way it is, and why 'equal' is different from 'identical'. Finally, we’ll talk about garbage collection, what reference counting is, and how CPython knows when it’s time to get rid of unused objects.

Whether you just want to understand what’s going on under the hood without having to dive into the implementation, or you’re on the hunt for some new diabolical things to do with code (self-referential lists are only the beginning!), come along to this talk and learn about the pointers in your Python.

To help people overcome this fear, we co-founded Data Science Academy - an NGO providing accessible data science education focused on building a collaborative community of data enthusiasts. Over the past year, we organized two week-long bootcamps Winter Data School and Summer Data School, as well as five shorter workshops, where we show the magic of Python and inspire people to continue their programming journey.

In this talk, we will share our story of how we set up Data Science Academy, what we do, and how we motivate people to take up data science. We will discuss why quality education and focus of attendees require a physical presence of multiple lecturers, and how to make transition to Python straightforward by drawing parallels with Excel and selecting the key concepts to explain. Lastly, we will demonstrate our unique teaching materials utilizing Jupyter Notebook, and how we use them in our workshops, and how participants on our events used them to advance their careers and set up new collaborations.

When working with timeseries representing the production data of power plants, the fundamental step is to define a good data structure. The shape of the dataframes must be a good balance between speed and memory usage to work with the right and up-to-date amount of data (cache invalidation). The parameters must have good names for fast and unambiguous identification (naming things). The time intervals must be the correct fit for observed physics to prevent mismatches (off-by-1 errors).

I'll show you a few Python tricks and my experience with how I solved these problems in my projects.

Anomalies, or outliers, in datasets can hold crucial information yet often remain elusive without proper tools. This presentation aims to demystify the concept of LOF and equip attendees with the knowledge to effectively identify and interpret local outliers in their own datasets.

The talk will commence with a brief overview of the theoretical underpinnings of LOF, shedding light on its ability to detect anomalies by comparing the local density of data points. We will explore the nuances of LOF, emphasizing its capacity to capture anomalies that might be overlooked by traditional methods.

We'll provide an overview of the steps involved and share practical insights into integrating LOF into data analysis workflows.

The talk will conclude by outlining considerations for parameter tuning and interpreting LOF results, providing attendees with a foundational understanding of how to apply LOF effectively in their data exploration endeavors.

By the end of the talk, attendees will have a solid understanding of the basics of LOF, its significance in anomaly detection, and the proficiency to apply this algorithm in Python. Whether you are a beginner seeking an introduction to outlier detection or an experienced practitioner looking to enhance your toolkit, this presentation promises to be a valuable exploration into the realm of local outlier factors.
