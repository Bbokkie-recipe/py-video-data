The Release Candidate is available, all features are in, and fixes for serious bugs are the only changes allowed before the final release in October. So you can already play with better traceback inforrmation, exception groups, performance improvements, tomllib, and so on.

But have you ever wondered how these features get into the language? If you have an idea of an improvement, what needs to happen before it's implemented and released to the world? Who needs to be convinced that it's a good idea? What kind of questions do you need to ask and answer?

Imagine that you need to get back to your code in 6 month after you wrote it, there is always a big possibility that you will have to spend some time to find out how this code works. Or if someone else wrote some code, which is already in production and your task is to fix a bug in it and there is no documentation and no one actually knows what this code does.

There are more benefits of implementing continuous documentation for the code:

- easy to onboard new team members,
- easy to share knowledge,
- if this code is open source - easy to start contributing,
- easy to see purpose and motivation of each piece of code,
- easy to keep versioning for each new release of the code.

It this talk I will show the difference between documentation types and will show a demo in the end of the talk.

Some scientific studies show that we spend over 90% of our time indoors [1]. Furthermore, advances in construction technology have caused a much better isolation, so a good ventilation is necessary. However, overventilation results in higher energy consumption usage but inadequate ventilation leads to indoor air quality that affects a person's comfort, health and even our ability to be focused and work effectively.

In order to improve my quality of life working from home, I decided to monitor and evaluate the air of my new working place (a.k.a living room). In this talk, we will explore how to build a functional system to track the air quality, collect our own data using different sensors and implement a predictive approach to avoid future health problems.

We are going to dive into the different setups to interact with air quality sensors using Python on microcontrollers and embedded systems (Raspberry pi), collecting your own data to evaluate different factors like humidity, temperature, CO2, particles, but that’s not all, also we will go into the implementation of a predictive machine learning (ML) model to predict Indoor CO2 levels and alerting us based on predictions before critical levels.

Assistants will see how Python is a great option to indoor air quality monitoring complemented with a predictive ML model for Indoor CO2, while having fun building and monitoring your home.

In this talk, Tom will suggest ways for you to use your powers wisely: to make a dent in global injustice, to help find solutions for society's most pressing problems and - ultimately - to find happiness.

Can you zoom in to a car license plate like in the movies? Can you task a satellite to take a picture for you? How can the satellite data be automatically processed?

In our presentation, we will try to answer those questions with the help of Python and libraries such as GDAL, rasterio, shapely, numpy, and pandas. We will discuss the resolution, data size, GeoJSON and geolocalized TIFF processing, visualization, surface reflectance, orbits, or use cases for non-optical data such as synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery, and other interesting aspects of this domain.

26,5 Things weve learned building large APIs with FastAPI - Maarten Huijsmans,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTSK6eRwyGM,HTSK6eRwyGM,PyCon SK,@pyconsk,https://www.youtube.com/@pyconsk,20220914,1845,6611,268,5.0,"Python,PyCon SK,Fast API",Science & Technology,"FastAPI follows the UNIX philosophy of ""do one thing, and do it well"". By using Starlette and Pydantic, FastAPI provides you with powerful tools to build a beautiful API. This gives you a lot of freedom to decide how you organize the rest of your codebase. The level of freedom also comes with some challenges once a codebase grows.

In this talk we explore some of the common challenges in building FastAPI apps, and share how we solved them:

1. Minimizing the global state with dependency injection
2. Reducing the complexity of testing a FastAPI app
3. Pitfalls of async FastAPI
4. Supporting multiple authentication schemes
5. Modeling the relations between patch, response, and database models

We will think about security, logging, and caching and see how to do it all in CI.

Quite a versatile one, as there are cases this is sold as the AI. And it is also quite old, standing the decades of passing time.

But the reality is not ideal, sometimes quite far from the ideal.

Let’s look at a few examples where good engineering practices were ignored which caused massive damages to the companies that weren’t following them. We will look at practices that would prevent the situations from happening. Stories like this will hopefully remind us why good engineering practices are necessary and maybe even help us to recognize which are more important than the others.
