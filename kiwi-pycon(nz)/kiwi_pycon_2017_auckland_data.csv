Dr. John Graves of Qrious offers a handy way to help people understand how better algorithms yield better performance. This supports an exploration of big data's four ""super powers"" -- See New Things and Act -- and the conclusion that learning from big data is the ""new oil"".

The Automat project is a pythonic approach to state machines, in that the user describes all their states, inputs and outputs using standard python idioms. Automat encapsulates your use of a state machine, users of your state machine don't actually have to learn about state machines, or even know there's a state machine inside, all they call are standard Python methods on an instance.

The client server model of programming implemented by utilizing the System D-Bus as the path for communication.  The System D-Bus has the advantages that server processes will continue to run if the User logs out and systemd auto-starts the servers on booting. The method of communication over the D-Bus is through using the pydbus library. A Raspberry Pi will be used for a demonstration.

Python can be used to add functionality to QGIS (an open source GIS) and at Land Information New Zealand (LINZ) we have been using increasingly more complex and specialized scripts, tools, and plugins utilising the PyQGIS API to improve how we work. This talk will cover using python to enhance and extend QGIS, using examples of our plugins, and will cover the lessons learnt and useful resources.

Local development is easy, until you get down to the nitty gritty of dealing with your environment, backend services, reproducibility, and deployment. Developing with docker-compose provides an opportunity to get up and running quickly and to share your work with others, regardless of their operating system or tooling. This talk will take you through the process from start to finish.

Steve wolfram asserted that all machines can be classified ito one of four classes. However classification has been shown to be undecidable.  I suggest we can separate complex machines into class III and class IV. I use this ability to analyse the role of recombination in resistance to ageing and the role of recombination in arms races

Python programmers are finding their web application development environment besieged by an invader: Node.js/npm. War against them seems like an enticing option, but it only brings discord and misery to the environment. This talk introduces a mediator that seeks to bring coexistence through enhancements of existing foundations and disarmament, so all Python packages can enjoy the resulting calm.

BigQuery is a Google tool to quickly analyse large sets of data. A web console and CLI tools are available, but we can also use BigQuery's remote API and Python libraries. In this talk we will introduce BigQuery and use Python to manage a project and analyse some data. Most of the examples found online are either too basic or very advanced. We hope to land somewhere between those extremes.

Entry points are one of the most powerful, yet mysterious, ways to customise the behaviour of Python projects. With just a few lines of code in your `setup.py` file, you can install command-line applications, inject features into other libraries, create plugins, and more! During this session, we will explore what entry points are, how they work, and how to use them in your Python projects.

Python includes a good logging library. However beginning to use it is not always straight forward. Eventually one ends up copy-pasting  Stackoverflow answers or going back to print(). 
I would like to give you a brief introduction to the logging module, explain some of its core principals and share some knowledge that will allow you to use it without getting in your way.
