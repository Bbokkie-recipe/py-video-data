You organise everything into folders – now you have importing problems and your code stops running :-(. You try random “solutions” from Stack Overflow: add empty init.py files everywhere; swap back and forth between relative and absolute importing; hack sys.path; consider hacking package; read endless “explanations”, many of them out-of-date. Tears. This talk provides simple guidelines that always work. Never be anxious when considering code re-organisation again.",

Structured logs are a great start, but nowadays there are frameworks that give you a vast amount of data about the internals of your application, in ways that remain usable even when your application gets... complex.\n\nOpenTelemetry is \"a collection of tools, APIs, and SDKs. Use it to instrument, generate, collect, and export telemetry data (metrics, logs, and traces) to help you analyze your software’s performance and behavior.\"\n\nOkay, so how do I use it?\n\nIn this talk, I'd like to present you with a practical guide to getting underway with using the Python OpenTelemetry SDKs and APIs. How to get them integrated into your application, and how to get the most out of them.",

We are also researching novel ways to rapidly identify and locate spacecraft during the most dangerous phase of their life cycle: immediately after launch.\n\nIn this talk, I will discuss our current research and development projects, and the central role Python plays in them.

I had no formal exposure to Python and all I understood during my first year were \"classical mechanics\" and \"laboratory practicals\". It was during the semester break that year when I accidentally bumped into a gold mine, a beautiful pedagogical introduction to Python. This talk tells the story of this unexpected encounter, and how eventually it made me fall in love with Python. This talk tells the story of how my mindset totally changed surrounding what I envisioned to be when I finished my degrees. Obviously, it wasn't easy. The journey comes with a lot of hurdles. This is a story of how a programming language inculcated in me the courage to take the road not usually taken. I think I am making Robert Frost proud!\n\nThe general issue that I plan to address through this talk is how in mainstream academia taking risks is not that simple. I somehow managed to take the leap of faith and Python has always been my anchor. I simply hope the audience can resonate with this story of mine.\n\nThe purpose of this talk is twofold:\n1. To convey that it is perfectly fine to break free and pursue whatever career one is comfortable with. Python made me realize my goals.\n2. To give an overview of how I, a mathematics Ph.D. student, have been using Python for several projects ever since.",

While the official Operator Framework SDKs are great, did you know that you can also use Python and a handy framework called Kopf to write your own Operators?\n\nCome with me on a journey through the world of Kubernetes Operators, what are they, why you might want one, and how you can write one using Python and the Kopf (Kubernetes Operators Framework). Kopf makes it easy to write a Kubernetes Operator using Python's simplicity and expressiveness to control Kubernetes' complex, stateful applications.\n\nI'll cover an overview of what Kubernetes Operators are for anyone unfamiliar with them or the Kubernetes mechanisms they use under the hood. Then its on to Kopf, exploring its architecture, advantages, and how it fits into the Kubernetes ecosystem, what it does and what it doesn't do. Finishing up with a walk through an example of a basic Kubernetes Operator using Kopf, discussing best practices along the way.\n\nWhether you're a Pythonista interested in Kubernetes, or a Kubernetes enthusiast eager to leverage Python's power, this talk is for you.",

We will delve into best practices to ensure the client's expectations for security, maintainability, scalability, and availability are consistently met. Participants will learn how to effectively collaborate with less technical teams, extract the necessary information, and standardise development to reduce new project overhead.\n\nIn the context of Python development, we will discuss the differentiation between common and custom code, and how to judiciously use each to maintain project efficiency and uniqueness. The presentation will underscore the importance of peer reviews and a team-play approach, highlighting how these foster knowledge sharing, continuous improvement, and code quality.\n\nThe talk will also provide insights on conveying progress, risks, and challenges to the broader team, ensuring transparency and early mitigation of potential issues. We will explore strategies to meet increasing demand, including continuous hiring and effectively onboarding graduates. The challenges of rapid hiring will be addressed, along with strategies to quickly identify skill gaps.\n\nWe will delve into the importance of establishing a supportive, ego-free environment that encourages open communication, mutual respect, and continual learning.\n\nThe talk aims to empower Python developers and team leaders with the knowledge and tools to improve project delivery, team collaboration, and customer satisfaction in a challenging, fast-paced environment.",

        "description": "The Python community has long celebrated simplicity as a virtue. For people coming from more complicated languages, an expressive syntax makes it simpler to express complex ideas. For people new to programming, Python’s choice of program structure and built-ins make it simple to learn.\n\nBut Python has grown. Developers are using Python in more mission-critical places, Python codebases are getting bigger, and the features that make Python simple in small programs don’t matter as much.\n\nIt’s little wonder that the Python ecosystem’s relationship with simplicity has changed a lot since the first release of Python 3: Libraries like requests (and lately httpx) focused on simplifying common tasks that the standard library made complex, at the expense of a more complex architecture; type hints added complexity to writing code to prioritise simplicity or testing and maintenance; newer code quality tools like ruff have prioritised simplifying development workflows by using a single complex tool, instead of focusing on simpler tools that serve a single purpose.\n\nIn this talk, we’ll explore how the Python community used to think about simplicity, how we think about simplicity now that Python is used for ever more complex tasks, and consider whether “simple is better than complex” is advice that Pythonistas can meaningfully follow.",
