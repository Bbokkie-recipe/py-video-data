        "description": "(Laura Bell) Facing a global pandemic has been (and continues to be) an incredibly challenging period. There are very few people who have not seen dramatic impacts on their lives as a result.\r\n\r\nWhile we as humans have been facing this struggle, a similar problem has been emerging in our software development community. Not only are we finding more vulnerabilities in our software than ever, but those weaknesses have been affecting a larger proportion of our software ecosystem.Are there lessons we can take from the last few years and the changes we have made to protect people from a pandemic and apply them to our software ecosystem? I believe there are.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we will look at how the relationships between software projects improve our world whilst also making us vulnerable. We will do this by diving into the structures between codebases and looking at how these affect the risk faced by our people, data, and systems.\r\n\r\nWe will then take a look at the harm that has been caused (and could yet be caused) by exploiting this ecosystem and the steps we can take to reduce this risk and increase the resilience of all our systems — steps that mirror the hard lessons we have learned as humans over the past few years. These steps include:\r\n\r\nTracing: Awareness of our software coupling and interconnectivity\r\nDistancing: Architectural patterns for maintaining safe distances between components and systems\r\nTesting: Reduction of risk through the use of manual and automated tools\r\nPrevention:  Through the use of patches and updates\r\nResponse: Preparing to respond when a problem happens.\n\nhttps://pretalx.com/kiwipycon-2021/talk/3L9QMN/\n\nkiwipycon kiwipyconxi kiwipycon22 kiwipycon2022 pycon python\n\nKiwi PyCon is an annual conference aimed at promoting and educating people about the Python programming language.\n\nLicenced as CC BY-NC-SA\n\nProduced by Next Day Video Australia: https://nextdayvideo.com.au\n\nFri Aug 19 09:20:00 2022 at Great Hall",

        "description": "(Christopher Neugebauer) Python is a language where there should be one (and preferably only one) obvious way to do things. But how does something become the obvious way to do a thing?\r\n\r\nConvention is the idea that most people agree on the right way to do things, and encourage other people to do things that way. Construction is the idea that providing the structures to do things in a particular way will cause people to do things that way. \r\n\r\nBoth Convention and Construction can be used to shape the norms of a programming language.\r\n\r\nPython, unusually amongst popular languages, prefers rigid structures as a way to extend the language. It prefers Construction over Convention. In this talk, I'm going to explore how Python's preference towards rigid structure has shaped its growth, and what role — if any — Convention has played in shaping Python.\n\nhttps://pretalx.com/kiwipycon-2021/talk/QJG97G/\n\nkiwipycon kiwipyconxi kiwipycon22 kiwipycon2022 pycon python\n\nKiwi PyCon is an annual conference aimed at promoting and educating people about the Python programming language.\n\nLicensed as CC BY-NC-SA - http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/\n\nProduced by Next Day Video Australia: https://nextdayvideo.com.au\n\nSat Aug 20 09:20:00 2022 at Great Hall",

Is a language with type hinting, structural pattern matching, and at least three different concurrency paradigms still brain-sized? Faced with so many implementation alternatives, it is often difficult to recognise which is the \"one obvious way to do it\". In this talk, we will explore how to decide when or when not to use a particular Python language feature, paradigm, or tool. We will tackle what we consider to be the most challenging decisions routinely faced by Python developers.\n\nhttps://pretalx.com/kiwipycon-2021/talk/QBSWJQ/\n\nkiwipycon kiwipyconxi kiwipycon22 kiwipycon2022 pycon python\n\nKiwi PyCon is an annual conference aimed at promoting and educating people about the Python programming language.\n\nLicensed as CC BY-NC-SA - http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/\n\nProduced by Next Day Video Australia: https://nextdayvideo.com.au\n\nSat Aug 20 11:30:00 2022 at Great Hall",

These things \"just work\" with built in and standard\r\nlibrary types. They can just work with your classes too. All that's required\r\nis implementing the right _dunder methods_. You've seen these before, like\r\n`__init__()`. We call them dunder methods because they have leading and trailing underscores in their names.\r\n\r\nIn this tutorial we will see what dunder methods are already doing for you,\r\nand then see how you can leverage their power in your own classes to help\r\nwrite more beautiful and readable code. If you have a handle on the basics\r\nof classes and objects and are interested in making them more powerful and\r\n_Pythonic_, then this tutorial will help you.\r\n\r\nBonus: If you've ever wondered why `__init__()` takes a `self` argument, you'll learn why.\n\nhttps://pretalx.com/kiwipycon-2021/talk/DGT7BF/\n\nkiwipycon kiwipyconxi kiwipycon22 kiwipycon2022 pycon python\n\nKiwi PyCon is an annual conference aimed at promoting and educating people about the Python programming language.\n\nLicensed as CC BY-NC-SA - http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/\n\nProduced by Next Day Video Australia: https://nextdayvideo.com.au\n\nFri Aug 19 10:40:00 2022 at Great Hall",

In this talk, I’ll share how our lean little startup team bootstrapped our pipeline as simply and cheaply as possible using the Python skills that we already had. This enabled us to quickly reach the next stage of our startup’s growth, without getting bogged down by steep learning curves.\r\n\r\nI will talk about the thinking behind our decision to use Python to build out our production data pipeline, which powers our culture analytics dashboard product. Mostly it was “oh heck, oh heck, okay, let’s just use Python”, but in hindsight, we’re stoked with that choice, and I’ll explain why. I’ll also show some examples of how we’ve iterated on the pipeline as we’ve grown, now that the product is out in the wild serving real beta customers. I hope that by sharing our experience of using Python in production, it might lower the barrier for people who want to bring their data product to life, by encouraging them to give their MVP a shot with the Python that they already know.\n\nhttps://pretalx.com/kiwipycon-2021/talk/YPVCJG/\n\nkiwipycon kiwipyconxi kiwipycon22 kiwipycon2022 pycon python\n\nKiwi PyCon is an annual conference aimed at promoting and educating people about the Python programming language.\n\nLicensed as CC BY-NC-SA - http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/\n\nProduced by Next Day Video Australia: https://nextdayvideo.com.au\n\nSun Aug 21 11:30:00 2022 at Great Hall",

        "description": "(Amith Murthy) Network security tools in the industry commonly rely on rulesets or signature-based detection for identifying attacks. A signature-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) uses thousands of known attack traffic signatures to identify malicious traffic in a network, providing little protection against unknown or new (zero-day) attacks. While anomaly-based detection techniques hold the promise of detecting zero-day attacks by learning the normal traffic behaviour in the network to identify deviations that signal attack traffic behaviour. However, traditional computer networks have high variability of ‘normal’ traffic which results in legitimate behaviour being incorrectly identified as malicious or vice versa – garnering the reputation they have poor operational performance.\r\nIoT devices, on the other hand, have limited functions and capabilities resulting in predictable communication patterns. Applying anomaly-based techniques in IoT networks therefore holds some promise. State-of-the-art research in academia has shown the use of Machine Learning (ML) techniques to develop traffic classification systems for IoT networks to be an effective endeavour. \r\nThis talk will highlight the application of unsupervised IoT traffic classification systems in Python, trained and tested on IoT network traffic data stored in packet captures. You will learn:\r\n- How to build your own traffic classifiers, from parsing packet capture data to implementing a machine learning pipeline that classifies device traffic as either normal or malicious. \r\n- How to build your own network analytics engine to investigate a devices’ traffic patterns from a packet capture, such as flow analysis \r\n- How to use time-binning algorithms to fingerprint IoT device traffic based on its traffic rate\r\n- How K-Means clustering algorithm can be used for detecting anomalies that represent malicious traffic in a device. \r\n\r\nThe rapid deployment of IoT networks, without adequate security measures has already led to attacks. Notably smart vending machines in a university campus network being exploited to attack the university’s systems [1]. Thus, this talk aims to inspire beginners and experts to look into the rapidly evolving field of ML-based IoT security solutions and to go out and build their own!\r\n\r\nReference\r\n\r\n[1] M.

Researchers continuously develop state-of-the-art (SOTA) AI algorithms to improve the performance of the AI system. But model-centric approaches are limited in the absence of quality data. Data-centric AI is an emerging approach towards solving machine learning (ML) problems. It is a collection of various data manipulation techniques that allow ML practitioners to systematically improve the quality of the data used in an ML pipeline. However, data-centric AI approaches are not well documented. Researchers/data practitioners develop various data experiments without any clear set of guidelines.\n\nhttps://pretalx.com/kiwipycon-2021/talk/PNHES7/\n\nkiwipycon kiwipyconxi kiwipycon22 kiwipycon2022 pycon python\n\nKiwi PyCon is an annual conference aimed at promoting and educating people about the Python programming language.\n\nLicensed as CC BY-NC-SA - http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/\n\nProduced by Next Day Video Australia: https://nextdayvideo.com.au\n\nSat Aug 20 15:20:00 2022 at Rutherford’s Den Lecture Theatre",

These objects, known as trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) have only been discovered, studied, and classified in recent decades. Studying TNOs is key to comprehending how our Solar System was formed, and a key part of the “how did we get here?” story. \r\n\r\nMy research involves a survey of over 160 individual TNOs; these images have been acquired over the span of five years using the 3.5-m Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope located on Maunakea, Hawai’i. But, before I can delve into analysing this rich dataset, I first have to collate the metadata associated with every TNO observation that was done. In this talk, I will detail how I use Pandas dataframes to maintain a “card catalog” of observations, and how it has been useful for my research—from figuring out exactly how many unique TNOs have been imaged to creating of a timeline that graphically shows all observations.\n\nhttps://pretalx.com/kiwipycon-2021/talk/RVWVST/\n\nkiwipycon kiwipyconxi kiwipycon22 kiwipycon2022 pycon python\n\nKiwi PyCon is an annual conference aimed at promoting and educating people about the Python programming language.\n\nLicensed as CC BY-NC-SA - http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/\n\nProduced by Next Day Video Australia: https://nextdayvideo.com.au\n\nSat Aug 20 14:20:00 2022 at Great Hall",

Frameworks are a dime a dozen (https://youtu.be/Wm2h0cbvsw8), and often Python programmers will immediately think of Django, even if they've never used it.  Django is the proverbial sledgehammer to crack a walnut... it can do it, but it's probably overkill.  Flask, on the other hand, is more of a small, clever pocketknife that you can easily add a walnut cracking tool to if you need it.  They both do the same thing - they just do it from different directions.
