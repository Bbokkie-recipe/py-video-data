This is a story of how a programming language inculcated in me the courage to take the road not usually taken. I think I am making Robert Frost proud!

The general issue that I plan to address through this talk is how in mainstream academia taking risks is not that simple. I somehow managed to take the leap of faith and Python has always been my anchor. I simply hope the audience can resonate with this story of mine.

The purpose of this talk is twofold:
1. To convey that it is perfectly fine to break free and pursue whatever career one is comfortable with. Python made me realize my goals.

Have you then trembled with fear, looking at your single, thousand line file, with global variables, multi parameter functions, and zero classes, not knowing where to start?

Or do you question why changing your complex code and fixing bugs takes so long?

Then come and learn about how refactoring can not only be fun and educational, but also profitable!

Often in programming projects, we find ourselves building layers and layers on top of a starting idea, without having been able to think about the long term design.

And that's fine! But unless push comes to shove, we often don't get the time or incentive to sit down and clean it up, especially if it all works.

In this talk, we'll discuss why you should care about good pythonic code, and how refactoring can not only be profitable, but also a fun and educational experience!

We'll look at easy to use tools and techniques that Python offers to make the process faster and future proof.

And finally, we'll cover some design principles and methodologies to keep in mind, alongside understandable real world examples.

For people coming from more complicated languages, an expressive syntax makes it simpler to express complex ideas. For people new to programming, Python’s choice of program structure and built-ins make it simple to learn.

But Python has grown. Developers are using Python in more mission-critical places, Python codebases are getting bigger, and the features that make Python simple in small programs don’t matter as much.

It’s little wonder that the Python ecosystem’s relationship with simplicity has changed a lot since the first release of Python 3: Libraries like requests (and lately httpx) focused on simplifying common tasks that the standard library made complex, at the expense of a more complex architecture; type hints added complexity to writing code to prioritise simplicity or testing and maintenance; newer code quality tools like ruff have prioritised simplifying development workflows by using a single complex tool, instead of focusing on simpler tools that serve a single purpose.
