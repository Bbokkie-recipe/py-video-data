However, building and testing data pipelines can be challenging when the real data is not available, either due to privacy issues, technical limitations, or simply because the data is not yet collected. How can we ensure that our data pipelines are robust and reliable without having access to the actual data?\n\nIn this talk, we will share our experience of creating synthetic data to test data pipelines using Python. We will demonstrate how we used some statistical methods and Python packages such as Faker and SDV to generate realistic synthetic data for different use cases, such as customer profiles, transactions, and time series. We will also show how we used Flyway to load the synthetic data into a Postgres database and perform repeatable deployments. We will discuss the benefits and challenges of using synthetic data for testing data pipelines, as well as some best practices and tips for creating and using synthetic data effectively.\n\nThis talk is aimed at intermediate-level Python developers who are interested in learning more about synthetic data generation and testing techniques for data pipelines. The talk will include code examples and live demos of the tools and methods we used. By the end of this talk, you will have a better understanding of how to build a data pipeline without data using Python.\n\n\nSponsors:\n  Platinum:\n    Python Software Foundation: https://www.python.org/psf/membership\n  Patron:\n    Thinkst Canary: https://canary.tools/\n    Afrolabs: http://www.afrolabs.co.za/",

        "description": "Talk page: https://za.pycon.org/talks/37-from-chaos-to-zen-lessons-learned-from-developing-user-friendly-apis/\n\n\nSpeaker: Stefan Van der Merwe\n\nTrack: Other\n\nType: Talk\n\nRoom: Main Hall\n\nTime: Oct 05 (Thu): 14:15\n\nDuration: 0:45\n\nIn the world of software development, APIs act as the middlemen between complicated systems and the people who work with them - developers. However, in this exchange of data and instructions, we often forget a fundamental truth: developers are people, not robots. It's time our APIs start recognizing and respecting this simple fact.\n\nJoin us on our journey to create APIs that are as user-friendly as possible. In this PyCon talk, we'll dive into the intriguing realm of designing Python package APIs and share the valuable lessons we've learned along the way.\n\nFrom our own experiences, we've uncovered some golden rules for API design: don't use inconsistent names, don't make data types unpredictable, keep documentation clear and consistent, and always handle errors gracefully. Ignoring these principles can turn an API into a confusing maze for developers.\n\nBut we won't just point out the pitfalls; we'll also guide you through common mistakes to avoid, such as insufficient documentation, unnecessarily simple or overly complex endpoints, and a lack of transparency regarding rate limits and quotas.\n\nIt's important to note that APIs aren't limited to web services; they can take various forms. During this presentation, we'll focus on Python package APIs and demonstrate how these principles apply to different situations.\n\nAs a shining example of well-designed web service API clients, we encourage you to check out the Google API Python Client. For Python package API design, explore the Polars project, which is a great project to study.\n\nAdditionally, we'll share a compelling case study related to a product we heavily use. This real-world example will help you understand these principles in action.\n\nExpect relatable stories, practical tips, and a fresh perspective on API design. Our mission is crystal clear: to bring empathy-driven design into the world of API development, one Python package at a time. Join us on this journey to add a touch of Zen to the sometimes chaotic world of coding.\n\n\nSponsors:\n  Platinum:\n    Python Software Foundation: https://www.python.org/psf/membership\n  Patron:\n    Thinkst Canary: https://canary.tools/\n    Afrolabs: http://www.afrolabs.co.za/",

        "description": "Talk page: https://za.pycon.org/talks/13-dynamically-serving-rest-endpoints-for-database-stored-procedures-with-fastapi/\n\n\nSpeaker: Kim van Wyk\n\nTrack: Web\n\nType: Talk\n\nRoom: Talk Room 1\n\nTime: Oct 06 (Fri): 09:00\n\nDuration: 0:45\n\nThis talk covers 1 approach to making stored procedures in an internal database available as REST endpoints for easier access to internal or even external parties. Like many organisations my employer has a large set of useful stored procedures in their primary database (MS SQL Server in this case) which provide a variety of important functions to the business. It would add value to several business areas and external partners to be able to use these stored procedures but providing wide-spread direct database access has significant security and data visibility issues.\n\nI discuss a 2 step approach to solve this - using SQLAlchemy to dynamically determine the details of the available stored procedures and then using Jinja2 to generate Pydantic models and FastAPI endpoints for each stored procedure. Jinja2 is most commonly associated with HTML templating, particularly in Django. It can however be run standalone and can generate any text, not just HTML, including in this case Python code.\n\nI will also discuss deployment via a Docker container with the capacity to generate up-to-date endpoints when the container is spun up.\n\nThe talk should hopefully be of interest to mid-level Python developers, covering a solution to an issue that many developers have probably not needed to consider.\n\n\nURLs:\n  Slides (pdf): https://2023.za.pycon.org/media/pages_files/Dynamic_database_REST_endpoints_with_FastAPI.pdf\n  Gitlab Repo: https://gitlab.com/kimvanwyk/pyconza2023-talk\n\n\nSponsors:\n  Platinum:\n    Python Software Foundation: https://www.python.org/psf/membership\n  Patron:\n    Thinkst Canary: https://canary.tools/\n    Afrolabs: http://www.afrolabs.co.za/",

And what's not to like? It's flexible, fast, very extensible and it's open source in addition to all of this!\n\nExcept ... when it's not. There are some technical down-sides to VSCode (especially if you don't have an expensive modern computer), and much of what makes VSCode exceptionally useful isn't actually open source and could be detrimental to the ecosystem as a whole.\n\nI will spend some time in this talk going over the pros and cons of VSCode, its useful features for developers in general and Pythonistas in particular, and importantly the caveats, why I think that it's best avoided.\n\nI will end with an impassioned plea to the local Python community to rely primarily on properly free (libre) software tools for the bulk of their development, I'll demonstrate some of the ones I use, and briefly mention a few other alternatives.\n\n\nSponsors:\n  Platinum:\n    Python Software Foundation: https://www.python.org/psf/membership\n  Patron:\n    Thinkst Canary: https://canary.tools/\n    Afrolabs: http://www.afrolabs.co.za/",

PRQL combines the elegance of relational algebra with the usability of popular libraries like Pandas, Polars, dplyr, and LINQ, offering a functional, pipelined query paradigm with modern ergonomics and expressivity. The talk will highlight PRQL’s adaptability to complex analytical queries, demonstrated through interactive examples in Python.\n\nAs a modern replacement of SQL, PRQL is built around the organizing principle of pipelined relational queries, and facilitated by a compact set of orthogonal language constructs. These constructs enable seamless composition of complex data pipelines, streamlining data filtering, data transformation, and data aggregation processes. PRQL incorporates modern ergonomics like f-strings, @date literals, and a ?? coalesce operator, as well features such as functions and loop based iteration that have long been missing from SQL.\n\nBeyond seamlessly transpiling into SQL, PRQL also supports multiple SQL dialects. This ensures compatibility with any relational database and data warehouse and allows you to leverage your existing data infrastructure.\n\nPRQL is a completely open-source (Apache 2.0 licensed) and volunteer-driven project and is committed to staying that way forever. Having gained over 8400 stars on GitHub in just over a year, the community response has been incredibly enthusiastic and encouraging! Join us and learn about the futur of data transformation!\n\n\nSponsors:\n  Platinum:\n    Python Software Foundation: https://www.python.org/psf/membership\n  Patron:\n    Thinkst Canary: https://canary.tools/\n    Afrolabs: http://www.afrolabs.co.za/",

        "description": "Talk page: https://za.pycon.org/talks/7-packaging-for-your-database-schema-schema-migration/\n\n\nSpeaker: Iwan Vosloo\n\nTrack: Other\n\nType: Talk\n\nRoom: Main Hall\n\nTime: Oct 05 (Thu): 11:00\n\nDuration: 0:45\n\nPython \"distribution packages\" result in the wheels you can distribute via PyPI and install using pip ans in so doing provide an excellent way to re-use the code written by others. Each such package contains code and a declaration of which other packages (and which version of such packages) it depends on. This allows one to install a version of a package you wish to use and be assured all its dependencies will also be installed, at their correct versions.\n\nPython distribution packages thus make it easy to dependably re-use code written by others. What about re-using code that rely on a database, and a particular database schema though?\n\nThere are tools that allow you to manage database schema and also migrate a database schema to keep up with changing code. However, we are not aware of tools that cater for the possibility that different authors could package code in different distribution packages, each package with its own declaration of what slice of database schema the code it contains need. In this scenario one would have to be able to create a final database schema for a project from the combined set of all the packages in a given final project --- each package providing its own slice of the final database schema. This should be done without the original authors of each of the individual packages having known at the time of authoring their packages which other slices of database schema their package would eventually co-inhabit a database with.\n\nSuch packages can also depend on each other on a database schema level: the database schema of one package can have a foreign key referring to the primary key belonging to the schema of another package. On a database level this is similar to one package importing code from another upon which it depends.\n\nCode changes and so would the database schema slice that goes with it. Hence a requirement of this idea is to be able to take a database with existing data in a schema created for a given set of packages and migrate its schema and data to an upgraded set of such interdependent packages.\n\nAs a side-line to our experiments with Reahl we have pioneered such database-aware distribution packages as an extension of setuptools. Our \"components\" not only include database schema metadata, but also configuration and internationalisation information specific to a component.\n\nThis talk focuses on the database side of things and presents an overview of the problems involved and how we solved them.\n\n\nURLs:\n  Slides (pdf): https://2023.za.pycon.org/media/pages_files/Packaging_your_database_schema.pdf\n  Slides (odp): https://2023.za.pycon.org/media/pages_files/Packaging_your_database_schema.odp\n  Slides (docs.google.com): https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1FmfPDEndijZitbI-ovJt-7S0ei7CmFasuPCvuAWj2zY/edit#slide=id.p\n\n\nSponsors:\n  Platinum:\n    Python Software Foundation: https://www.python.org/psf/membership\n  Patron:\n    Thinkst Canary: https://canary.tools/\n    Afrolabs: http://www.afrolabs.co.za/",

Here’s an example of that from the langchain docs.\n\nfrom langchain.document_loaders import WebBaseLoader\n\nfrom langchain.indexes import VectorstoreIndexCreator\n\nloader = WebBaseLoader(\"http://www.paulgraham.com/greatwork.html\")\n\nindex = VectorstoreIndexCreator().from_loaders([loader])\n\nindex.query(\"What should I work on?\")\n\nWhich outputs an answer specific to Paul Graham’s essay:\n\n\"The work you choose should ideally have three qualities: it should be something you have a natural aptitude for, something you have a deep interest in, and something that offers scope to do great work. If you're unsure, you could start by working on your own projects that seem excitingly ambitious to you...\"\n\nThe first time you run this it feels like pure magic. How does this work?\n\nThe answer is a process called retrieval augmented generation, or RAG for short. It is a remarkably simple concept, though also has incredible depth in the details of its implementation.\n\nThis entry-level talk will provide a high-level overview of RAG, suitable for all audiences. We’ll start from the big picture workflow of what’s happening, and then zoom in on all the individual pieces. By the end of it, you should have a solid understanding of how those three magic lines of Python code work, and all the principles involved in creating these Q&A bots. It will include details about LLMs, Embeddings, Vector Databases, and more.\n\n\nURLs:\n  Slides: https://2023.za.pycon.org/media/pages_files/How_do_domain-specific_chatbots_work__PyCon_ZA_2023.pdf\n\n\nSponsors:\n  Platinum:\n    Python Software Foundation: https://www.python.org/psf/membership\n  Patron:\n    Thinkst Canary: https://canary.tools/\n    Afrolabs: http://www.afrolabs.co.za/",

The Digital Object Identifier (DOI) system, vital to this process, ensures unique, persistent identifiers for digital objects. Previously, we used a manual process of creating DOIs which was daunting and error-prone, especially for scholarly articles with multiple authors. This talk illustrates a Python solution to mitigate these challenges by automating the DOI creation.\n\nPython is the ideal tool for this endeavour because of its simplicity and adaptability. We will discuss the nature of the DOI system, how to cite data using it, and the challenges associated with manually producing DOIs. Furthermore, the presentation will take attendees through a hands-on example of a Python script constructed to speed up a DOI creation.\n\nThe powerful libraries that Python provides, grant us access to make DOI creation as smooth as possible. Thus contributing to the research workflow and enabling the creation to be less error-prone. Creating DOIs helps to cite papers better, making research more transparent and available for reuse. The intended impact of the attendees is to understand how Python can play a critical role to automate DOI creation, furthermore gaining the necessary skills to leverage Python libraries to automate such solutions in their own research. Regardless of whether you are a Software engineer, a librarian, a researcher or a data manager, this session will give information on how one can use Python to improve data citation practices and add to the greater quality of the digital scholarly infrastructure.\n\nBonus, Now that attendees are familiar with how we have used Python to solve a tedious manual process. We are also cognisant that our Python code is of great quality. We measure that code is of great quality by how high or low the value of the piece of code is. Generally, code that is easy to interpret and well-documented is considered to be of high quality. Here are some of the common quantifiers of code that are of high quality. Code that is functional, consistent, easy to understand, meets the client’s needs, is testable, reusable, free of bugs and well documented. These quantifiers are used to check if the automation of DOI creation code is of high or low quality.\n\n\nURLs:\n  Slides (pptx): https://2023.za.pycon.org/media/pages_files/Pycon__Unlocking_efficiency.pptx\n  Slides (pdf): https://2023.za.pycon.org/media/pages_files/Pycon__Unlocking_efficiency.pdf\n\n\nSponsors:\n  Platinum:\n    Python Software Foundation: https://www.python.org/psf/membership\n  Patron:\n    Thinkst Canary: https://canary.tools/\n    Afrolabs: http://www.afrolabs.co.za/",

Mainstream GIS activities involve geoprocessing, visualisation of data using desktop GIS and in some limited cases web GIS. Python can be used in most cases to streamline the different Geospatial processing workflows that are available in most Desktop GIS software. This talk will take users on a journey of how to process data (‎ETL- Extract transform and load vs Extract Load Transform (ELT)), store the data in a PostgreSQL database and leverage Python to publish the data into web GIS (Spatial Data Infrastructure). The second part will also explore how Python is utilized to facilitate mobile data capture. This will briefly explore how to design data capture forms and how to manage data in the field so that it can be visualized in the web GIS (Spatial data infrastructure).\n\n\nSponsors:\n  Platinum:\n    Python Software Foundation: https://www.python.org/psf/membership\n  Patron:\n    Thinkst Canary: https://canary.tools/\n    Afrolabs: http://www.afrolabs.co.za/",

It runs for two weeks in February of each year with classes and tutorials running from 9:00 to 16:00 each weekday. It is a collaborative effort between the CSIR's Centre for High Performance Computing (CHPC) and the National Institute for Theoretical & Computational Sciences (NITheCS).\n\nThis year, the CSS brought together nearly 800 postgraduate students and professionals from different fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) from across South Africa. The event marked several significant milestones, including bringing together participants from 29 different research institutes in South Africa for the first time. It was the first time that a coding training event of this scale was conducted in a hybrid format in South Africa, allowing participants to engage with their peers and course presenters in-person while also joining virtually. Week 1 focused on the fundamentals of Python, Pandas and Bash. Week 2 focused advanced Python applications, covering the foundations linear algebra, probability theory, ODEs, and machine learning.\n\nIn this talk, I will discuss the significant milestones that were reached in Python education in South Africa focusing on LMS technology, end-to-end course design, engagement, automation of marking and certification. I will also discuss the lessons learnt and how we can reach more students and cross the language barriers in South Africa. It was the first time the CSS participants had the option to learn material in isiXhosa. This talk should be of benefit to any attendee involved in teaching and education.\n\nReference: https://events.chpc.ac.za/event/115/\n\n\nSponsors:\n  Platinum:\n    Python Software Foundation: https://www.python.org/psf/membership\n  Patron:\n    Thinkst Canary: https://canary.tools/\n    Afrolabs: http://www.afrolabs.co.za/",

Perhaps more importantly, what kind of data should these APIs serve up?\n\nWithin the City of Cape Town, in the Data Science branch, we've been experimenting in the open, and believe that we have some answers. Our experiences have led us towards simple yet effective HTTP-based data APIs that furnish our citizens with crucial information. Join us in this presentation as we delve into the practical applications of these APIs, with a spotlight on the pivotal role played by the Python ecosystem.\n\nFor several years, we've collaborated closely with our colleagues in the Electricity Generation and Distribution department to disseminate a status file, detailing the current load shedding stage in the City. This year, with unprecedented loadshedding, we've taken our efforts to the next level. We're not only providing more comprehensive load shedding schedules in a programmatic format, but we've also automated the generation of these status files. Additionally, we're now broadcasting significant events such as schedule updates or stage changes via a popular PubSub platform with numerous integration points.\n\nIn a more recent collaboration with our counterparts in Customer Relations, we've initiated the near real time publication of data regarding \"service alerts\" – sizeable service disruptions that could potentially affect many residents. This initiative has been spurred by the remarkable changes in the communication landscape over the past few years - consequently, we recognise the need to deliver authoritative and clear information to the public, unencumbered by platforms controlled by 3rd parties.\n\nIn both instances, the core offerings essentially consist of small, rapidly mutating JSON files served up by CDNs. The production of these files involves relatively straightforward data pipelines, primarily composed using batteries-included Python. These pipelines are deployed using both localised and serverless infrastructure configurations. We'll also illustrate how this approach proves to be resilient, astonishingly cost-effective, and conducive to rapid development.\n\nOur belief is that the power of this approach lies in its simplicity yet the importance of its content. By delivering critical information to our residents in the simplest possible digital form, we unlock countless possibilities for use - from highly scaleable resident facing websites, to popular apps, this approach has proved itself in practice.\n\n\nSponsors:\n  Platinum:\n    Python Software Foundation: https://www.python.org/psf/membership\n  Patron:\n    Thinkst Canary: https://canary.tools/\n    Afrolabs: http://www.afrolabs.co.za/",

In the streaming setting, data is unceasing, potentially unbounded, and continuously evolving with time. A tool that can be used as an extension on the Massive Online Analysis (MOA) framework is River, a Python library. This talk will introduce listeners how to use River to do machine learning on streaming data. River library supports different machine learning tasks, including regression, classification, and unsupervised learning. It also supports tasks such as computing online metrics and concept drift detection. River can be used to build a machine learning pipeline and evaluate the model’s performance on a streaming dataset.\n\n\nURLs:\n  Slides (pptm): https://2023.za.pycon.org/media/pages_files/pyconza_conf.pptm\n  Slides (pdf) (converted): https://2023.za.pycon.org/media/pages_files/pyconza_conf.pdf\n\n\nSponsors:\n  Platinum:\n    Python Software Foundation: https://www.python.org/psf/membership\n  Patron:\n    Thinkst Canary: https://canary.tools/\n    Afrolabs: http://www.afrolabs.co.za/",

In this talk, we'll try to convince those who love them to use them in a way that those who hate them, hate them less.\n\nWe'll start by talking about what makes Jupyter Notebooks indispensable, and what makes them awful. We'll also talk about the various ways people use notebooks. As part of this we'll do a whirlwind tour through IDE options, from local Jupyter in your browser through to the many managed cloud-based options available today.\n\nThen we'll describe some of the patterns and tooling you can use to make your Notebooks less awful (perhaps even beautiful!). Some principles we'll discuss are: good coding practice and style (using nbqa and other code quality tools), version control and reviewing (using Github, Jupyterlab git extensions, nbdime, nbdev, and ReviewNB), testing (using nbval, nbmake, testbook), dependency management (virtual environments, requirements files, Docker), and automating your code quality efforts (Github actions).\n\nThe ecosystem of tooling for Jupyter Notebooks is growing, with new packages and features being developed to help smooth over some of Jupyter Notebooks' limitations. This review will give you a birds eye view of some of the current tooling your team can adopt to improve the quality of your Notebooks!\n\n\nURLs:\n  Slides (pdf): https://2023.za.pycon.org/media/pages_files/PyConZA_2023_making_notebooks_less_awful.pdf\n\n\nSponsors:\n  Platinum:\n    Python Software Foundation: https://www.python.org/psf/membership\n  Patron:\n    Thinkst Canary: https://canary.tools/\n    Afrolabs: http://www.afrolabs.co.za/",
