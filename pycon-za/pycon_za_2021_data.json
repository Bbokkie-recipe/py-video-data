The team behind the BioEnergy Atlas for South Africa have developed a methodology and toolset that address a number of these unknowns, allowing for modeled scenarios for bioenergy production to be developed and compared.\r\n\r\nThis talk show cases how complex and computationally intensive spatial problems can be broken down into relatively simple components that are solvable using scientific compute methodologies and libraries in python.\r\n\r\nThe components of the modelling process discussed in this talk include:\r\n\r\n1. Creation of a transport network where no roads exist using scikit-image\r\n\r\n2. Geolocation of optimal potential facility locations based on the road transport costs and BioEnergy feedstock spatial location using GDAL and NetworkX\r\n\r\n3. Calculation of BioEnergy Production costs per potential facility location (Pandas)\r\n\r\n 4. Presentation of Model Outputs using dashboards that facilitate Nexus type comparisons (Dash and Plotly).\r\n\r\nRoom: Video Room 1\r\nScheduled start: 2021-10-06 14:30:00\r\nSponsors:\r\n\r\n  Gold:\r\n    SPAN Digital: https://spandigital.com/\r\n    Takealot: http://takealot.com/\r\n    Andela: https://www.andela.com/\r\n\r\n  Silver:\r\n    Python Software Foundation: https://www.python.org/psf/membership\r\n    OfferZen: https://www.offerzen.com/\r\n\r\n  Patron:\r\n    Thinkst Canary: https://canary.tools/\r\n    Afrolabs: http://www.afrolabs.co.za/",

A framework to help Flask users get started quickly with a great architecture and features never seen before in the Flask world. It allows Flask people to have Django powers, and beyond. It allows the use of apps/modules with the addition of a concept called box. It also supports some Django commands like collectstatic. It comes with tests and docs ready to go. We also included a few touches of Masonite. It's much, much more than a Flask boilerplate project. In line with the Flask spirit it leaves much control of the wizardry in your hands, you the user.\r\n\r\nOutline\r\nThe framework was designed to spin big, flexible and organised projects. The talk presents the features of the project as well as setting up a demo project.\r\n\r\nRequirements\r\nThis talk is an advanced one. It requires the user to have knowledge of common packages like flask_login, sqlalchemy, alembic & flask_migrate, flask_wtf, sqlalchemy_wtf, of concepts like multi-profile configs and the app factory pattern etc. To be a well grounded Flask dev if you like. Just go over them if you are reading these lines as the talk needs at least a conceptual knowledge of those.\r\n\r\nWhy should you waste your time attending this presentation?\r\nI decided to present the conclusion of years and years of Flask development as a framework which allows you to stand on the shoulders of giants from day one.\r\n\r\nRoom: Video Room 1\r\nScheduled start: 2021-10-07 14:30:00\r\nSponsors:\r\n\r\n  Gold:\r\n    SPAN Digital: https://spandigital.com/\r\n    Takealot: http://takealot.com/\r\n    Andela: https://www.andela.com/\r\n\r\n  Silver:\r\n    Python Software Foundation: https://www.python.org/psf/membership\r\n    OfferZen: https://www.offerzen.com/\r\n\r\n  Patron:\r\n    Thinkst Canary: https://canary.tools/\r\n    Afrolabs: http://www.afrolabs.co.za/",

There are many moving parts and some services may be down at any time. To ensure that everything still works, we need to build in mechanisms to handle failure when requesting data from an upstream service.\r\n\r\nWe developed some patterns using retries and circuit breakers to make sure that we can handle a service being slow or unavailable, as well as not overwhelming it when it becomes available again.\r\n\r\nI will take you through some of techniques that we use to achieve this, as well as a live demo of the techniques in action.\r\n\r\nRoom: Video Room 1\r\nScheduled start: 2021-10-06 15:15:00",

There has been an increase of 30% in cyber-attacks compared to previous weeks. The pandemic has been the main reason for job loss and pay cuts of people and has led to an increase in cybercrimes. Examples of cyber-attacks include phishing, ransomware, fake news, fake medicine, extortion, and insider frauds. Cyber forensics is a field that deals with the investigation of digital crimes by analyzing, examining, identifying, and recovering digital evidence from electronic devices and producing them in the court of law. Python has a great collection of built-in modules for digital forensics tasks. The talk begins with an introduction to digital crimes, digital forensics, the process of investigation, and the collection of evidence. Next, I will cover the various python modules and built-in functions required to build your first cyber forensic application. The modules covered in the discussion are pyscreenshot, PIL, secrets, argparse, hashlib, os,csv, logging, time, sys, stat and NLTK. Finally, I will demonstrate using code walk through the sample cyber forensic application.\r\n\r\nOutline:\r\n\r\n1.

So when people plug their frontend tooling into Django certain wheels tend to get reinvented.\r\n\r\nEnter Redux. Redux is a teeny weeny and painfully elegent JavaScript library that works wonders with state managment. Redux is commonly associated with React, but it's not actually relient on React in any way. It's just JavaScript, it can actually be used just about anywhere that JS runs (yes, even a backend if you wanted to).\r\n\r\nI use Redux a lot and have built some web-frontend-framework agnostic tools that make it easy to manage your api data on any old js frontend and deal with forms that are backed by a DRF api. What's cool about this is that it's dead simple to useonce you have it set up, and it doesn't stop you fronm using other state managment tools for other parts of your application.\r\n\r\nI'm sure this tool has saved me weeks of pain and suffering. If you are into fullstack web dev and modern frontends then you might find this useful.\r\n\r\nRoom: Video Room 2\r\nScheduled start: 2021-10-06 16:30:00\r\nSponsors:\r\n\r\n  Gold:\r\n    SPAN Digital: https://spandigital.com/\r\n    Takealot: http://takealot.com/\r\n    Andela: https://www.andela.com/\r\n\r\n  Silver:\r\n    Python Software Foundation: https://www.python.org/psf/membership\r\n    OfferZen: https://www.offerzen.com/\r\n\r\n  Patron:\r\n    Thinkst Canary: https://canary.tools/\r\n    Afrolabs: http://www.afrolabs.co.za/",

Well... it's complicated. There are a lot of opinions out there.\r\n\r\nThis panel will include a few different voices. We'll have representation from industry, formal education and alt-education.\r\n\r\nParticipants:\r\n\r\nNhlanhla Lucky Nkosi is a Software Engineer in BBD’s dedicated Research and Development Unit (ATC) whose responsibilities include facilitating learning BBD's staff. He is a technical lecturer at Wits University's Digital Arts department and holds degrees in Engineering and Game Design. Lucky has experience in building and maintaining enterprise banking software with a vast range of technologies from VB6 and C# through to the modern web technologies which lie at the core of his current technical speciality and passion. Lucky hones this love for the web by also being a co-organiser of JoziJS.\r\n\r\nLucky is also incredibly involved in BBD's graduate program. This means he works with grads from formal education as well as alternative systems. He takes junior devs and trains up to BBD's high standards.\r\n\r\nSheena O'Connell is the CTO of Umuzi, a successful NPO that's all about launching high value digital careers. She designs curriculums in order to get people to a point where they can hit the ground running in various technical careers, does a lot of technical mentorship, and builds software and people processes to better facilitate and scale tech learning across Africa.\r\n\r\nTim Flusk is Associate Lecturer in Digital Arts at Wits University. He lecturers second and third years in game design and game development.\r\n\r\nHe was initially trained in game development and spent several years in the industry, and entered academia in an attempt to contribute to training of young developers and creating of knowledge and research within the media and technology space\r\n\r\nMiek Messerschmidt is a Senior Lecturer at The Department of Mathematics and Applied Mathematics at the University of Pretoria. He received a PhD in pure mathematics from Leiden University in The Netherlands in 2013. For a number of years Miek has taught introductory scientific computing using Python to first year science students at the University of Pretoria. With mixed success, he sometimes tries his hand at competitive gaming (ranked 1v1 Planetary Annihilation) and at arts and crafts (stereo photography, pottery, furniture design, bookbinding, crochet).\r\n\r\nRoom: Video Room 1\r\nScheduled start: 2021-10-08 12:30:00\r\nSponsors:\r\n\r\n  Gold:\r\n    SPAN Digital: https://spandigital.com/\r\n    Takealot: http://takealot.com/\r\n    Andela: https://www.andela.com/\r\n\r\n  Silver:\r\n    Python Software Foundation: https://www.python.org/psf/membership\r\n    OfferZen: https://www.offerzen.com/\r\n\r\n  Patron:\r\n    Thinkst Canary: https://canary.tools/\r\n    Afrolabs: http://www.afrolabs.co.za/",

This toolkit allows developers to create microservices using a cross-language, cross-platform architecture. It is currently available in six languages (Python, Golang, Node.js, Dart, .NET, and Java), and the idea behind it is to help create production-level long-living code.\r\n\r\nThis presentation will focus on explaining the main advantages that this toolkit presents, together with its architecture and main components. Then, it will show an example that demonstrates how easy is to create different microservises, and how, once created in one language, they can be easily migrated to other languages.\r\n\r\nRoom: Video Room 1\r\nScheduled start: 2021-10-08 13:45:00\r\nSponsors:\r\n\r\n  Gold:\r\n    SPAN Digital: https://spandigital.com/\r\n    Takealot: http://takealot.com/\r\n    Andela: https://www.andela.com/\r\n\r\n  Silver:\r\n    Python Software Foundation: https://www.python.org/psf/membership\r\n    OfferZen: https://www.offerzen.com/\r\n\r\n  Patron:\r\n    Thinkst Canary: https://canary.tools/\r\n    Afrolabs: http://www.afrolabs.co.za/",

However this is not trivial for computers and remains to be a challenging task as it involves both tracking humans as well as learning the semantics of the interaction taking place. This is an important problem in computer vision as solving it would allow for easy annotations of videos (paving way for awesome unsupervised learning!), automated surveillance, and quick content-based video retrieval (just imagine finding a video by describing actions in one go!). Attendees would find the most benefit from this talk if they are interested in computer vision and/or have some prior knowledge of convolutional architectures in machine learning, an additional benefit would be knowledge about action recognition however this is not too important.\n\nIn this talk, we introduce a novel self-supervised method (termed \"Sync-3D\") that learns spatio-temporal video embeddings to enable the detection of human interactions. Our work combines the I3D architecture used for action localisation and the siamese SyncNet architecture for video-audio synchronisation, casting the problem of human interaction detection as one of motion synchronisation both spatially and temporally. This talk will cover the motivations behind this architectural choice, our learning framework, a new data sampling strategy for curriculum learning, and lastly, how our architecture compares to others on the downstream task of interaction classification on the challenging TV-HID dataset. We will also be motivating some future research directions and pointing out certain improvements of this system.\n\nRoom: Video Room 2\nScheduled start: 2021-10-08 13:45:00\nSponsors:\n\n  Gold:\n    SPAN Digital: https://spandigital.com/\n    Takealot: http://takealot.com/\n    Andela: https://www.andela.com/\n\n  Silver:\n    Python Software Foundation: https://www.python.org/psf/membership\n    OfferZen: https://www.offerzen.com/\n\n  Patron:\n    Thinkst Canary: https://canary.tools/\n    Afrolabs: http://www.afrolabs.co.za/",

These include trying multiple algorithms and parameters to get the best results, tracking these runs for reproducibility, and moving the model to diverse deployment environments. This talk demonstrates the use of an open-source platform called MLflow for managing the complete machine learning lifecycle with Python. The talk requires a basic understanding of Python and Machine Learning concepts.\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\nIn theory, the crux of machine learning (ML) development lies with data collection, model creation, model training, and deployment. In reality, machine learning projects are not so straightforward. They are a cycle iterating between improving the data, model, and evaluation that is never really finished. Unlike in traditional software development, ML developers experiment with multiple algorithms, tools, and parameters to optimize performance, and they need to track these experiments to reproduce work. Furthermore, developers need to use many distinct systems to productionize models.\n\nIn this talk, we introduce MLflow, an open-source platform that aims at simplifying the entire ML lifecycle where we can use any ML library and development tool of our choice to reliably build and share ML applications. MLflow offers simple abstractions through lightweight APIs to package reproducible projects, track results, and encapsulate models that are compatible with existing tools, thereby, accelerating ML lifecycle of any size.\n\nWith the help of an example, we will show how using MLflow can ease bookkeeping of experiment runs and results across frameworks, quickly reproducing runs on any platform (cloud or local execution), and productionizing models on diverse deployment tools.\n\nAt the end of this talk, you will be familiar with –\n\nKey concepts, abstractions, and components of open-source MLflow\nHow each component of MLflow addresses challenges of ML lifecycle\nHow to use MLflow Tracking during model training to record experimental runs\nHow to use MLflow Tracking User Interface to visualize experimental runs with different tuning parameters and evaluation metrics\nHow to use MLflow Projects for packaging reusable and reproducible models\nHow to use MLflow Models general format to serve models using MLflow REST API\nThe purpose of the session is to introduce the audience to MLflow and give a taste of the ML development lifecycle. It is intended at providing a breadth than depth survey of MLflow platform, and we leave the audience to experiment with it further through takeaway exercises.\n\nPRE-REQUISITES\n\nBasic knowledge of Python programming language\nBasic understanding of machine learning concepts\nTRACK\n\nData Science in Production, Machine Learning, Data Engineering or MLOps\n\nRoom: Video Room 2\nScheduled start: 2021-10-08 14:30:00\nSponsors:\n\n  Gold:\n    SPAN Digital: https://spandigital.com/\n    Takealot: http://takealot.com/\n    Andela: https://www.andela.com/\n\n  Silver:\n    Python Software Foundation: https://www.python.org/psf/membership\n    OfferZen: https://www.offerzen.com/\n\n  Patron:\n    Thinkst Canary: https://canary.tools/\n    Afrolabs: http://www.afrolabs.co.za/",

The code and implementation were all in C and myself being accustomed to Python. I decided to migrate the Arduino project into MicroPython.\n\nThis is a basic introduction to working with microcontrollers in Python.\n\nThe automatic plant watering system runs on a WiFi-enabled Arduino ESP8266 running uPython, a capacitive soil moisture sensor reads the moisture content in the soil and uploads the data to ubidots which is a data collection, analysis, and visualization tool. A Slack message is sent to a specific channel when soil moisture reaches a threshold and a water pump notification is sent. The system operates 24/7.\n\nEvery 15 minutes it checks sensors in the following order and acts based on this:\n\n- Soil Humidity sensors. If soil humidity is lower than 70% in a plant pot\n- the system activates a water pump for 3 seconds and,\n- Sends a slack notification\n- Upload data to ubidots.\n\nRoom: Video Room 1\nScheduled start: 2021-10-08 15:45:00\nSponsors:\n\n  Gold:\n    SPAN Digital: https://spandigital.com/\n    Takealot: http://takealot.com/\n    Andela: https://www.andela.com/\n\n  Silver:\n    Python Software Foundation: https://www.python.org/psf/membership\n    OfferZen: https://www.offerzen.com/\n\n  Patron:\n    Thinkst Canary: https://canary.tools/\n    Afrolabs: http://www.afrolabs.co.za/",

Not only that, there are numerous use cases where operators run Kubernetes on top of OpenStack, they run Kubernetes supplemented with OpenStack services, or they run a containerized OpenStack. In this talk, attendees will learn about how companies can and ARE using Kubernetes WITH OpenStack. Viewers will walk away with a better understanding of the configurations possible and that Kubernetes and OpenStack go together like fishfingers and custard- if you like Doctor Who references- or cookies and milk if you prefer :)\n\nOpen Source projects like Kubernetes and OpenStack are successful and popular because they are open and compatible with other technologies. Open Source projects like OpenStack help supplement and provide underlying infrastructure to Kubernetes much to everyone’s surprise. Kubernetes isn’t a complete replacement for OpenStack like everyone seemed to think it was. Not only that, there are many companies that use the two technologies together in production and at scale.
