Seven years later, I am now a full-time “solopreneur”—running a portfolio of software products (written mostly in Python) as a full-time job. I now set my own hours, take vacation whenever I want, and, amazingly, earn more than I ever did as CTO.\n\nIn this talk, I’ll share how I did it and what I learned in the process. I’ll share the skills Python programmers should pick up in order to start selling software on the web, including both technical and non-technical ones. I’ll discuss how to get started, evaluating your ideas, building your product, and getting your first users and customers. The talk will draw from years of work building and selling software myself, as well as the experience I’ve gained from helping hundreds of others launch their own businesses.\n\nIf you’ve ever wanted to turn your coding skills into revenue-generating side-projects, I hope this talk both inspires and helps you to get started.\n\nSponsors:\n  Platinum:\n    Thinkst Canary: https://canary.tools/\n  Gold:\n    Python Software Foundation: https://www.python.org/psf-landing/\n    SARAO: https://www.sarao.ac.za/\n  Silver:\n    AWS: https://aws.amazon.com/\n    City of Cape Town: https://www.capetown.gov.za/\n  Patron:\n    Afrolabs: https://afrolabs.co.za/\n    Centre for High Performance Computing: http://www.chpc.ac.za/\n  Opportunity:\n    Black Python Devs: https://blackpythondevs.com/",
