It offers a simple and intuitive API for common date/time operations and provides advanced functionality for dealing with more complex scenarios. Some of the interesting points of Pendulum include support for leap years, time zones, and daylight saving time, as well as a fluent API for creating and modifying dates and times.\n\n\rOne of the standout features of Pendulum is its support for time zones. The library comes with a comprehensive list of time zones, and it can automatically adjust dates and times to the local time zone of a given location. Additionally, Pendulum can handle time zone conversions with ease, making it easy to work with date/time data across different time zones.\n\n\rPendulum also provides a powerful API for creating and modifying dates and times. With its fluent interface, developers can create and manipulate dates and times using a natural, human-readable syntax.\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",

However, despite the hype, only a small percentage, i.e. 13% of Machine Learning models see the light of day!\n\rWell, effectively building and deploying machine learning models is more of an art than science! ML models are indeed inherently complex, have fuzzy boundaries, and rely heavily on data distribution. But what if they are trained on biased data? Then they’ll generate highly biased decisions! As the famous saying goes by,  “Garbage in, garbage out,” so if the model is trained on skewed and unfair data distribution, they are bound to produce fuzzy output!\n\rSo, join me in this talk as I will share my learnings in developing effective practices to build and deploy ethical, fair and unbiased machine learning models into production.\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",

In this talk, we'll explore two popular architectures: Attention models and Diffusion models.\n\n\rFirst up, we'll discuss Attention models and how they've contributed to the success of large language models like ChatGPT. We'll explore how the Attention mechanism helps GPT focus on specific parts of a text sequence and how this mechanism has been applied to different tasks in natural language processing.\n\n\rNext, we'll dive into Diffusion models, a class of generative models that have shown remarkable performance in image synthesis. We'll explain how they work and their potential applications in the creative industry.\n\n\rThis is a good talk for visual learners. I prepared schematic diagrams, which present main features of the nerual network architectures. By necessity, the diagrams are oversimplified, but I believe they will allow you to gain some insight into Transformers and Latent Diffusion models.\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",

Providing access to this rich ecosystem in a protected environment, whilst also allowing developers to augment this with internally developed packages is a key enabling service. Existing open-source solutions didn’t meet our needs, and the evolving Package index standardisation, as well as exposure to dependency confusion attacks, left us searching for a more modular and flexible approach.  \n\n\n\rIn this presentation we will demonstrate the Python package upload, index, and browsing services developed at CERN. We will discuss the gradual transition from our existing repository service (based on Nexus), and demonstrate - with the help of recent packaging PEPs - the flexibility that modularising the services has brought, helping us to meet our needs for local specialisation and enhanced security measures.\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",

Mainly we will focus on how SQLAlchemy handles transactions and connections to the database and what issues we may face because of it.\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",

This enhancement of exception and cancellation handling has allowed asyncio to evolve more flexibly, addressing the existing issues with asyncio APIs, such as insufficient cancellation and exception handling in asyncio.gather.\n\n\rIn this talk, I would like to discuss the problems of existing asyncio APIs and how the newly introduced asyncio.TaskGroup() solves these issues. Attendees will learn about the improved way of handling exceptions and cancellations using asyncio.TaskGroup(), enabling them to write more efficient and robust asynchronous code with Python 3.11.\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",

But what if they could be even better? Thanks to PEP 701, Python 3.12 will ship with an improved version of f-strings that will once and for all fix the little remaining problems that f-strings have had, while also supercharging them with new cool powers.  In this talk, you will discover the dark little secrets of how f-strings were being processed before Python 3.12 and the many things that didn't work and you didn't know about. You will learn how we changed thousands of lines of manually written C code without anybody noticing, how we changed the oldest part of CPython so quotes behave like parentheses, and how we taught the PEG parser to understand f-strings. Plus, you'll gain an understanding of how these new and improved capabilities will provide several advantages for both end-users and library developers, while also reducing the maintenance cost of the CPython implementation.\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",

        "description": "[EuroPython 2023 — Forum Hall on 2023-07-20]\n\rhttps://ep2023.europython.eu/session/welcome-to-your-world\n\nIn 2018 the author, journalist and broadcaster Andrew Smith realized that although computer code now mediated almost everything he did, he understood next to nothing about it. The only way to participate in the growing debates around what our code should and should not do, he reasoned, would be to enter the world of the people writing it, by learning to code himself. Nice idea! In a near thirty year writing career, Smith had flown to the edge of space, slept under Spearfish torpedoes aboard a nuclear hunter-killer submarine, roamed the vast Victorian sewer system under London, spent six months on the road with Bianca Jagger, toured with artists including Radiohead and The Prodigy, and been perhaps the only person ever to shake Fidel Castro's hand by accident. None of which prepared him for the challenge of learning to code. After a miserable false start with JavaScript, a kindly C++ programmer pointed him in the direction of Python and he fell in love not just with the language, but with the remarkable community behind it. In this unusual keynote, Andrew, with help from his great friend and Python stalwart Nicholas Tollervey, will describe what he found—explaining the joys, frustrations and surprises, while touching on his experiences in Silicon Valley and the intriguing historical discoveries he made during his research. Smith's meditation on code's relationship to the wider world, Devil in the Stack: Searching for the Soul of the New Machine, will be published next March. This is his chance to share a preview of his reflections with the community that did so much to make them possible, of which he is grateful to consider himself a part.\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",

While most users are happy with the recommendations provided, there are a section of users who are curious how and why a certain track is recommended. Complex recommendation systems take various factors like track metadata, user metadata, and play counts along with the track content itself. \n\n\rInspired by Andrej Karpathy to build an own GPT, we have to use Language Models to build our own music recommendation system.\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",

Various teams were struck with FOMO (Fear of Missing Out) and hastened to incorporate Large Language Models (LLMs) into their products. By using OpenAI models (text-curie-001, davinci, gpt-3.5-turbo), we successfully integrated them into our production on March 2, granting our users the ability to receive text summaries in their email reports and comprehend the essence of any article within our application. Three weeks later, we trained our own large language model for the same purpose. This talk will delve into our journey, exploring the lessons and insights gleaned from our hands-on experience with these cutting-edge tools.\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",

Pretty quickly, we started writing them down; our brains aren't very good at storing all the things we know reliably, and we needed something more durable.\n\n\rA long time ago, this meant clay tablets with cuneiform on them, and things have only got more complicated from there. Nowadays, we try to store data so that computers can understand it too, and that's given us a bewildering array of options - portable hard drives, magnetic tape storage and so much more.\n\n\rIn this talk, we'll take a look at the history of data storage, and discuss why some methods have worked better than others. We'll talk about why writing things down for humans is different than doing it for computers, and why it's difficult to do both at the same time (this is what code is). Finally, we'll look at today's state-of-the-art for keeping data safe, and discuss what the future might hold.\n\n\rThis talk has no prerequisites, although a fondness for weird facts will help!\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",

One of the challenges for the next generation ML is to think small, you read that right “thinking small”. It’s time to start being able to have mechanisms with super well-trained ML models in small-devices: ML on Microcontrollers. We are going to dive into TinyML and evaluate different setups to interact with sensors on microcontrollers. We will discuss the different hardware options and frameworks to start with, while checking different use cases that TinyML can solve, like: agriculture, conservation, health issues detection, ecology monitoring etc. In this talk, you will learn about Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML), which is an approach that explores machine learning to be deployed in embedded systems that enable run ML on microcontrollers. Lastly, we will discuss real use-cases and a practical case that could be implemented at home\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",

Recently, we have started using computers for solving problems beyond computations, and it might not be wrong to call them electronic creators. The future laptop might have a prompt based word application, replacing the current Word, where one has to type their thoughts and formulate an entire document from  scratch. Similarly, we might see a prompt based Paint application, instead of the typical Paint program, that generates the paintings for us. In my opinion, AI-based applications are not in fiction anymore, and we may soon be using them on our computers. However, there is a possibilty that the Generative AI can be potentially harmful for society. We need to explore the ethical concerns, and how the AI can impact our society. In this talk, we will try to understand how Generative AI is becoming a part of our future and how we can use it in a responsible and ethical manner.\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",

Come and learn the basic concepts and how to use it, by modelling a traditional British fish and chips shop!\n_________________________\n[ *CORRECTIONS FROM THE SPEAKER* ]: \nWhen talking about two of the slides in the video, I say *\"topic\"* when I should have said *\"partition\".* Below is the text as it should be - the highlighted words are what I should have said.\n🔷 At 7:14 -  slide  *Multiple partitions, consumer groups:* \n🔹Sometimes that's not what you want. Sometimes you want your consumers to share the reading, so here we've got two *partitions,*  one with 1, 2, 3 and one with b, c, d in it.\n🔹The producers [...] can choose which partition by hand, say I want *partition* one, two, three, or you can say here is a key, choose by the key which *partition* to go to.\n🔹The consumers at the top right are in the same consumer group, they said \"we want to share consuming the *topic\".* \n🔹Each consumer will get one or more *partitions,*  but they won't both see the same *partitions.*  So one of them is seeing 1, 2, 3 and the other is seeing b, c, d. The bottom consumer is not in a consumer group, it's entirely independent, and like the previous consumers it's just getting all the messages in order.\n\n🔷 At 14:43  -  slide *Three tills:* \n🔹So now we're going to add three producers and we'll add three *partitions,*  because then we can say each till will send to a separate *partition.*  The food preparer is still reading from all of them so it will get things interleaved nicely.\n_________________________\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",

The core is an [open source AWS emulator](https://github.com/localstack/localstack) that is primarily written in Python. It is among the top Python projects on GitHub, and has seen a massive uptake in contributions over the past two years. Many Python software developers and architects will relate to the struggles of maintaining a large and complex Python codebase, while keeping developer teams productive. In this talk, we'll explore how we at LocalStack tackle these as we re-create AWS for local development. We'll explain our approaches to automating around AWS specifications, building a highly modular and pluggable system to make it easy for teams to integrate their components, the software patterns we use to keep devs productive, as well as our approach to automated contract testing using pytest.\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",

And how are we going to make 3.12 and following releases even faster?\n\n\r In this talk, I will present a high level overview of the approach we are taking to speeding up CPython. Starting with a simple overview of some basic principles, I will show how we can apply those to streamline and speedup CPython. I will try to avoid computer science and software engineering terminology, in favor of diagrams, a few simple examples, and some high-school math. Finally, I make some estimates about how much faster the next few releases of CPython will be, and how much faster Python could go.\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",

Its functionality can be expanded through addons that are also written in Python, which makes the ability to debug both the core and addon code highly desirable.\n\n\rHowever, debugging code within an embedded or packaged Python environment can be quite challenging, especially if you are a visually impaired programmer trying to debug your own screen reader, since hitting a breakpoint will freeze the tool you rely on for computer access!\n\n\rIn this presentation, I will demonstrate how I addressed this challenge by leveraging Microsoft's debugpy library for remote debugging. I will showcase how this technique can be used to debug Python applications running within an embedded Python environment, regardless of the host language. Additionally, I will explore its applicability in debugging applications running on different operating systems or environments than the one where you prefer to use your debugging IDE.\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",

However, data validation can often be a tedious and error-prone process, especially when dealing with complex data structures. Pydantic, a powerful and flexible data validation library for Python, simplifies the process of data validation by providing a declarative syntax that is easy to read and write.\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",

Do you want to take your skills to the next level and achieve maximum performance while minimising memory usage? Look no further, here is Zero-Copy in Python!\n\rZero-copy is a technique in computer programming that allows data to be transferred between different parts of a program without being copied to intermediate buffers. In Python, this technique can be achieved using the memory view object, which provides a view into the memory of other objects. Learn how to efficiently manipulate large datasets and optimise your code with the help of this powerful tool. Whether you're working with sockets, objects or memory profiling, memory view is your key to faster and more efficient Python programming.\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",

We all have! And while \"Favor composition over inheritance!\" is almost as old as object-oriented programming, strictly avoiding all types of subclassing leads to verbose, un-Pythonic code. So, what to do?\n\n\rThe discussion on composition vs. inheritance is so frustrating because far-reaching design decisions like this can only be made with the ecosystem in mind – and because there's more than one type of subclassing!\n\n\rLet's take a dogma-free stroll through the types of subclassing through a Pythonic lens and untangle some patterns and trade-offs together. By the end, you'll be more confident in deciding when subclassing will make your code more Pythonic and when composition will improve its clarity.\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",

To streamline infrastructure management, our team set out to design a REST API and constituent CLI (Command Line Interface) that would comprise a single interface for both programmatic and human interaction with our infrastructure. Traditionally, building a CLI that is tightly coupled to an API requires maintaining a separate codebase, which is tedious and error-prone. Instead, we designed a CLI that dynamically generates commands based on the OpenAPI JSON documentation. However, since APIs are designed for computer interaction, we designed our API to include the information needed to implement a human-friendly CLI. Leveraging Python, FastAPI, and numerous other open source projects, we built a stable, extensible tool that greatly improves how we interact with our infrastructure.\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",

The implementation of the PEP inspired the [Repository Service for TUF (RSTUF)](http://repository-service-tuf.readthedocs.io/), a project [accepted into the OpenSSF sandbox](https://github.com/ossf/tac/pull/137). We identified that the design could benefit other organizations and repositories looking to secure their software supply chains.\n\rIn this talk we would answer the following questions: \n\r- How did the PEP 458 design help to start the Repository Service for TUF (RSTUF)?\n\r- How could RSTUF be used for PyPI with its millions of packages?\n\r- How can RSTUF be deployed by any organization at any scale without requiring TUF expertise?\n\n\rAdditionally, in this talk, we would give an overview of PEP 458, how it works, and give a high-level overview of TUF.\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",

But as Python has matured, significant tooling has risen to improve the development experience (DX). Can you use this tooling, in a modern editor and IDE, to stay in the flow and make your development…joyful?\n\n\rIn this session we’ll put PyCharm to work, at helping us work. Navigation, refactoring, autocomplete – the usual suspects. We’ll also see “test-first” development to stay in the IDE, plus how this can apply to frontends.\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",

The fundamental concepts behind document anonymization are entity recognition, masking type, and pseudoanonymization. Using python language and a collection of libraries such as spacy, pytorch, and others we can achieve good scores of anonymization. How is this applied within a flow containing AI models for NER? Once anonymized how to improve the result by doing more text mining with python based apps and human in the loop. Although it was approved in 2016, the application of the GDPR at the European level remains a challenge in banking, legal, and other contexts. This talk covers the process of transforming pdf and docx documents into xml, processing them using regexp and spacy/torch models, and how to parse these results using AntConc and Textacy. All the ideas will be supported with the real experience of the MAPA project a European project for anonymization finished in 2022.\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",

Somehow, just by looking at the screen, your phone recognizes you (and only you) and magically unlocks.\n\n\rHave you ever stopped for a minute and thought to yourself - How does that even work? And maybe more importantly, how secure is it?\n\n\rIn this session, we're going to understand how facial recognition works under the hood. We'll dive into some potential security problems, and we'll show you how we were able to break into a biometric database built on the Dlib-python-library by applying a sophisticated brute-force attack. The results will surprise you.\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",

This is necessary for some of its dynamic nature, like virtualenvs but can also be harnessed to make the interpreter experience truly personal.\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",

In the data science space, the pickle module has become one of the most popular ways to serialise and distribute machine learning models - yet, pickles introduce a wide range of problems. For starters, it is incredibly easy to poison a pickle. Once this happens, a poisoned pickle can be used by an attacker to inject any arbitrary code into your ML pipelines. And what’s even worse: it’s incredibly hard to detect if a pickle has been poisoned!\n\n\rGood news? Help is on the way! You now have access to an increasing number of tools to help you generate higher-quality pickles. And when those are not enough, you can always draw inspiration from the DevOps movement and their trust-or-discard processes.\n\n\rThis talk will show you how widespread pickles are and how easy it is to poison models serialised with pickle, but also how easy it is to start protecting them from attacks.\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",

In combination with Machine Learning, they allow for an unprecedented capability; one can train AI models on simulations, where the evolution history of galaxies is available, that can in turn be applied on real galaxies. In this work, we propose the use of Python as a ML tool, through the popular library Tensorflow, to quantify the impact of different cosmological models on the derivation of the history of galaxies. Python accompanies us at every step of the way, from creating the datasets and training the probabilistic neural networks to the visualization of the results, as we attempt to shed light on the cosmic past of galaxies, surpassing the unshakeable reality that we can only observe them at a specific moment in time.\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",

There was a need to extract the data, make it meaningful and open to public, so we have come up with afetharita.com. The machine learning part of the application is completely based on open-source tools in Python and I will go through the pipeline and the process.\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",

For that to happen, the application must separate the domain layer— where elements that represent the real world reside—from the infrastructure layer—where these elements are translated into precise software processes.\n\n\rWithin the Fintech team at Kiwi.com, we are rearchitecting a critical service to accept more payment providers. As part of this refactor, we are adopting the Unit of Work pattern to disentangle domain entities from the database processes that represent them. This way, domain experts can share their knowledge with developers more easily, and developers can find opportunities for optimization without the involvement of domain experts in the process.\n\n\rAttendees will gain a solid understanding of how to implement the UoW pattern in their Python applications, how it fits into the broader context of DDD, and how to prepare their code for future growth.\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",

But are eBPF programs limited to the operating system kernel? eBPF programs have fast access to resources like memory. These programs can access the memory of running Python applications very faster, allowing you to instrument Python processes with low overhead!\n\n\rIn my presentation, I will show how Python's internal structure supports instrumentation through the use of eBPF. Following that, we'll experiment with eBPF and other modern techniques to instrumenting the Python applications. I'll explain explain why eBPF is more appropriate and efficient technology for instrumentation. By the end of the session, we will have developed an eBPF-based simple tracing tool for instrumenting Python applications.\n\n\rAfter this presentation, you will better understand how eBPF can help you in the instrumentation of Python applications.\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",

Running linters in distributed CI jobs makes it hard to understand the overall developer experience.\n\n\rIn this talk, we'll walk you through solving those scaling problems using a reusable linter framework that releases new linter updates automatically, reuses consistent configurations, runs linters on only updated code to speedup runtime, collects logs and metrics to provide observability, and builds auto fixes for common linter issues. Our linter runs are fast and scalable. Every week, they run 10k times on multiple millions of lines of code in over 25 codebases, generating 25k suggestions for more than 200 developers. Its autofixes also save 20 hours of developer time every week.\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",

Many of the new systems are shockingly impressive but impossible to replicate by individuals because they rely on complex machine learning techniques with huge datasets that aren't feasible to do in a home environment. Fortunately, there's an entire group of clever approaches to generate graphics that look cohesive, unique, and deliberate... and that you can easily do on your own computer.\n\n\rIn this short talk we'll go through a few of those algorithms like Clifford attractors, slime mold simulation, and reduction of source imagery to geometric primitives. We'll generate images and animations, we'll dabble in 2D and 3D. You'll leave the talk with your own ideas how to create attractive visualizations out of thin air. The talk assumes familiarity with Python and high-school math.\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",

As more compute engines, storages and databases start to speak arrow, you might be relying on it without even knowing.\n\rThe same transformation is happening with Substrait, that is on track to be the standard representation of query plans themselves. Allowing queries to be routed to different engines as far as they speak substrait, or even decomposed and forwarded to different engines.\n\rThis talk we will provide a quick introduction to the Arrow ecosystem, showing to Python developers how libraries like Pandas, Polars and PyArrow itself leverage Arrow and how compute engines like Velox, Datafusion and Acero are embracing Arrow and Substrait.\n\rThe talk will also show how a basic database system based on Arrow and Substrait can be built with a minimum amount of code thanks to all the foundations they provide.\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",

In this talk, I'll show you that \"logging\" is easy to learn and use, giving you far more flexibility than you can get from inserting calls to \"print\" all over your code. I'll show you how you can start to use \"logging\" right away -- but also how you can use it to create a sophisticated logging system that sends different types of output to different destinations. After this talk, you'll know how to use \"logging\", and you'll be less likely to use \"print\" in your applications.\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",

However, uncovering the 3D structure has for a long time been redeemed by months of hard work in the lab. Recent advances in Machine learning and Natural language processing have made it possible to build models (eg. AlphaFold) capable of predicting the protein's 3D structure with the same precision as experimental methods.\n\n\rIn this talk, I will explore an even more specific application of language models for proteins - the detection of a knot in a protein's 3D structure solely from the protein amino acid sequence. Knotting in proteins is a phenomenon that can affect their function and stability. Thanks to NLP and interpretation techniques we can try to uncover why and how proteins tie themself into a knot. In this research, we rely on many Python-based tools starting from Biopython to Pymol and Hugging Face transformer library.\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",

However, we would feel \rdeficiencies in proper SW engineering supports at some point as the notebook grows to have larger and more complicated code. It is because the Jupyter notebook lacks several important features including code sharing, refactoring support, \rversion control and advanced editing. Fortunately, traditional full-fledged IDEs,\r such as _VS Code_ or _PyCharm,_ are available at hand and they support \rthese lacking features very well. \rThen, why don’t we take advantage of the best of both worlds?\n\n\rIn this beginner-level hands-on talk, I will demonstrate how to \rtransform Jupyter notebook workflows to a proper Python package using _VS Code._ \rI will also introduce several basic but essential refactoring recommendations. By doing so, you can use the package for several notebooks \rand even share with your colleagues and friends.\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",

What will the future look like? Are we going to only talk to bots? Will prompting replace programming? Or are we just hyping up unreliable parrots and burning money? In this talk, I'll present visions for NLP in the age of LLMs and a pragmatic, practical approach for how to use Large Language Models to ship more successful NLP projects from prototype to production today.\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",

But, with so many testing techniques available, it can be challenging to know which one to use. While unit testing is a popular technique, it's not always the most effective or efficient way to ensure software quality. In this talk, we’ll explore spec-based testing, a technique that focuses on verifying that the software behaves in accordance with its specifications or requirements.\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",

        "description": "[EuroPython 2023 — Terrace 2A on 2023-07-19]\n\rhttps://ep2023.europython.eu/session/spiral-python\n\nMost introductory Python books and online resources like w3schools.com try to be complete when a new concept is explained. This does not always work well for beginners. E.g. if you have just grasped how a while-loop  works, it may cause too much cognitive load to also understand the break and continue options, let alone the else clause.\n\n\rThe learning psychologist Jerome Bruner introduced the term \"spiral learning\". The idea is that you don't teach all aspects of a new concept, but just enough to use it. At a later stage a teacher can revisit the subject and explain more details, when a student needs this to take the next step.\n\n\rSpiral Python is a road map of subjects that can be found in any introductory book or online resource about Python, but absolutely original in the sense that it takes into account how people learn in a natural way. You do not need to know the whole language before you can use it. Spiral Python also contains exercises (to practice) and challenges (to motivate).\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",

While these solutions work well to visualize megabyte-sized datasets, web technologies struggle to render gigabyte or larger datasets efficiently, because they transfer all the data into the client browser. Pre-rendering the data on the server using a tool like Datashader can visualize such large datasets efficiently, but the resulting static renderings make exploring individual datapoints difficult.\n\n\rThis talk demonstrates how the HoloViz ecosystem of tools (holoviz.org) allows you to run exploratory notebooks and build dashboards that do server-side rendering of billions of data points without losing the ability to interactively inspect and annotate individual samples in the browser.\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",

DuckDB is a novel data management system that executes analytical SQL queries without requiring a server. DuckDB has a unique, in-depth integration with the existing PyData ecosystem. This integration allows DuckDB to query and output data from and to other Python libraries without copying it. This makes DuckDB an essential tool for the data scientist. In a live demo, we will showcase how DuckDB performs and integrates with the most used Python data-wrangling tool, Pandas. \n\rBesides learning about DuckDB's main charactestics, users will also experience a live demo of DuckDB and Pandas in a typical data science scenario, focusing on comparing their performance and usability while showcasing their cooperation. The demo is most interesting for an audience familiar with Python, the Pandas API, and SQL.\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",

Temporal.io, an open-source microservice orchestration platform, is introduced as a robust solution capable of using event sourcing for durability, scalability, and resilience, effectively managing system failures. Temporal based asyncio event loop implementation adds seamless durability to Python code. The complete state of the program, including local variables and await calls, is fully preserved across process and other infra failures. We highlight real-world applications and conclude by emphasizing how Temporal transforms the design and implementation of distributed fault-tolerant systems.\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",

But what if you need to update Python because of a security issue,\n\rbut cannot (yet) move to a newer version of a dependency? Or you are running a\n\rproprietary binary extension that cannot easily be recompiled?\n\n\rThe HPy project provides a better C extension API for Python. It compiles to\n\rbinaries that work across all versions of CPython, PyPy, GraalPy. HPy makes\n\rporting from the existing C API easy and its design ensures that the binaries\n\rwe produce today stay binary compatible with future Python versions.\n\n\rNumPy is the single largest direct user of the CPython C API we know of. After\n\rover 2 years of work and more than 30k lines of code ported, we can demonstrate\n\rNumPy running its tests and benchmarks with HPy. We will show the same NumPy\n\rbinary run on multiple CPython versions and GraalPy. And we will discuss\n\rperformance characteristics of this port across CPython, GraalPy, and PyPy.\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",

They are great for dashboarding and business intelligence (BI) use cases due to their ease-of-use. However, their combination might not be the best choice for every problem. More precisely, business-critical data pipelines with high complexity might be better suited for frameworks such as Apache Spark which greatly benefit from the tight integration with general purpose languages like Python (e.g., PySpark). \n\n\rExpect an opinionated comparison between Apache Spark and seemingly easier-to-use cloud native SQL engines. By the end of this talk, you will be challenged to think about why they are complementary and when each has its justification.\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",

Have you ever wondered how data integrity is maintained with the data across multiple nodes? One of the key components of achieving this is distributed consensus. Raft is a widely used consensus algorithm that provides a fault-tolerant and highly available system. In this talk, we will explore how to implement Raft consensus using the rqlite distributed database in python.\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",

The Rust programming language offers powerful alternatives with strong compile-time and memory safety guarantees. In this talk, I'll explore how data engineers can leverage Rust to build high-performance data pipelines and processing systems. I'll cover the Rust ecosystem for data work, including frameworks and libraries for working with data formats, databases, streaming systems, and scientific computing. By combining Rust and Python, data engineers can harness the benefits of both languages and build robust end-to-end data systems that scale to meet demanding production needs.\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",
