Computer pRogramming, Technology, Bit-coinism Success, Climate Change and Billionaires are all associated with one another.
This talk will describe how a cohort of  299+ young people (aged 11-14) were introduced to Python Programming, at the same time, for the very first time.
And in this talk, I  would like to share with a great secret in that I have actually learnt more from the young students than they learnt from me. 
This talk is about how these young people have opened my eyes, mind  and heart about alternative ways of looking at and appreciating:- 
The humble IF statement;  the under-rated FOR loop, the dry Return Statement, the functional Maths & Random modules, etc. as if one were an artist.
We will talk about the renewed delight of looking at these things from fresh pairs of eyes and how we can take these new learnings forward.

https://ep2023.europython.eu/session/time-made-easy-simplify-date-and-time-handling-with-pythons-pendulum

Pendulum is a Python package for working with dates, times, and timezones. It offers a simple and intuitive API for common date/time operations and provides advanced functionality for dealing with more complex scenarios. Some of the interesting points of Pendulum include support for leap years, time zones, and daylight saving time, as well as a fluent API for creating and modifying dates and times.

One of the standout features of Pendulum is its support for time zones. The library comes with a comprehensive list of time zones, and it can automatically adjust dates and times to the local time zone of a given location. Additionally, Pendulum can handle time zone conversions with ease, making it easy to work with date/time data across different time zones.

Pendulum also provides a powerful API for creating and modifying dates and times. With its fluent interface, developers can create and manipulate dates and times using a natural, human-readable syntax.

https://ep2023.europython.eu/session/building-and-deploying-fair-and-unbiased-ml-systems-an-art-not-science

There has been a renaissance around Artificial Intelligence systems in recent years. However, despite the hype, only a small percentage, i.e. 13% of Machine Learning models see the light of day!
Well, effectively building and deploying machine learning models is more of an art than science! ML models are indeed inherently complex, have fuzzy boundaries, and rely heavily on data distribution. But what if they are trained on biased data? Then they’ll generate highly biased decisions! As the famous saying goes by,  “Garbage in, garbage out,” so if the model is trained on skewed and unfair data distribution, they are bound to produce fuzzy output!
So, join me in this talk as I will share my learnings in developing effective practices to build and deploy ethical, fair and unbiased machine learning models into production.

https://ep2023.europython.eu/session/scipp-multi-dimensional-arrays-with-labeled-dimensions-and-physical-units

Inspired by Xarray, Scipp ([scipp.github.io](https://scipp.github.io)) enriches raw NumPy-like multi-dimensional data arrays by adding named dimensions and associated coordinates.
For an even more intuitive and less error-prone user experience, Scipp adds physical units to arrays and their coordinates.
Scipp data arrays additionally support a dictionary of masks, as well as histogram bin-edge coordinates.

One of Scipp's key features is the possibility of using multi-dimensional non-destructive binning to sort record-based ""tabular""/""event"" data into arrays of bins.
This provides fast and flexible binning, rebinning, and filtering operations, all while preserving the original individual records.

Scipp ships with data display and visualization features for Jupyter notebooks, including a powerful plotting interface.
Named Plopp, this tool uses a graph of connected nodes to provide interactivity between multiple plots and widgets, requiring only a few lines of code from the user.

[Python dunder methods](https://mathspp.com/blog/pydonts/dunder-methods) – like `__init__` – are sometimes referred to as “magic methods” but they are not!

They are just regular methods!

Functions that are associated with objects and that you can call with arguments.

The only thing is... Python also calls those functions behind the scenes in certain situations!

So, let us learn what that is all about.

https://ep2023.europython.eu/session/understanding-neural-network-architectures-with-attention-and-diffusion

Neural networks have revolutionized AI, enabling machines to learn from data and make intelligent decisions. In this talk, we'll explore two popular architectures: Attention models and Diffusion models.

First up, we'll discuss Attention models and how they've contributed to the success of large language models like ChatGPT. We'll explore how the Attention mechanism helps GPT focus on specific parts of a text sequence and how this mechanism has been applied to different tasks in natural language processing.

Next, we'll dive into Diffusion models, a class of generative models that have shown remarkable performance in image synthesis. We'll explain how they work and their potential applications in the creative industry.

This is a good talk for visual learners. I prepared schematic diagrams, which present main features of the nerual network architectures. By necessity, the diagrams are oversimplified, but I believe they will allow you to gain some insight into Transformers and Latent Diffusion models.

https://ep2023.europython.eu/session/the-python-package-repository-accelerating-software-development-at-cern

Python’s expressive syntax, ease of use, and powerful ecosystem of third-party packages are all major contributing factors to its thriving use for accelerator controls at CERN. Providing access to this rich ecosystem in a protected environment, whilst also allowing developers to augment this with internally developed packages is a key enabling service. Existing open-source solutions didn’t meet our needs, and the evolving Package index standardisation, as well as exposure to dependency confusion attacks, left us searching for a more modular and flexible approach.  


In this presentation we will demonstrate the Python package upload, index, and browsing services developed at CERN. We will discuss the gradual transition from our existing repository service (based on Nexus), and demonstrate - with the help of recent packaging PEPs - the flexibility that modularising the services has brought, helping us to meet our needs for local specialisation and enhanced security measures.

With the release of Python 3.11 in October 2022, PEP 654 ""Exception Groups and except"" was accepted, and asyncio.TaskGroup() was added. This enhancement of exception and cancellation handling has allowed asyncio to evolve more flexibly, addressing the existing issues with asyncio APIs, such as insufficient cancellation and exception handling in asyncio.gather.

In this talk, I would like to discuss the problems of existing asyncio APIs and how the newly introduced asyncio.TaskGroup() solves these issues. Attendees will learn about the improved way of handling exceptions and cancellations using asyncio.TaskGroup(), enabling them to write more efficient and robust asynchronous code with Python 3.11.

In this talk, you will discover the dark little secrets of how f-strings were being processed before Python 3.12 and the many things that didn't work and you didn't know about. You will learn how we changed thousands of lines of manually written C code without anybody noticing, how we changed the oldest part of CPython so quotes behave like parentheses, and how we taught the PEG parser to understand f-strings. Plus, you'll gain an understanding of how these new and improved capabilities will provide several advantages for both end-users and library developers, while also reducing the maintenance cost of the CPython implementation.

https://ep2023.europython.eu/session/welcome-to-your-world

In 2018 the author, journalist and broadcaster Andrew Smith realized that although computer code now mediated almost everything he did, he understood next to nothing about it. The only way to participate in the growing debates around what our code should and should not do, he reasoned, would be to enter the world of the people writing it, by learning to code himself. Nice idea! In a near thirty year writing career, Smith had flown to the edge of space, slept under Spearfish torpedoes aboard a nuclear hunter-killer submarine, roamed the vast Victorian sewer system under London, spent six months on the road with Bianca Jagger, toured with artists including Radiohead and The Prodigy, and been perhaps the only person ever to shake Fidel Castro's hand by accident. None of which prepared him for the challenge of learning to code. After a miserable false start with JavaScript, a kindly C++ programmer pointed him in the direction of Python and he fell in love not just with the language, but with the remarkable community behind it. In this unusual keynote, Andrew, with help from his great friend and Python stalwart Nicholas Tollervey, will describe what he found—explaining the joys, frustrations and surprises, while touching on his experiences in Silicon Valley and the intriguing historical discoveries he made during his research. Smith's meditation on code's relationship to the wider world, Devil in the Stack: Searching for the Soul of the New Machine, will be published next March. This is his chance to share a preview of his reflections with the community that did so much to make them possible, of which he is grateful to consider himself a part.

Systems built with microservices tend to become complex over time. There are several approaches that encapsulate complex distributed system layouts with an API Gateway, or backends for frontends. Having a GraphQL gateway is one of the available options. This method of delivering client-facing APIs has become the standard with modern single-page applications.

Music streaming services like Spotify and youtube are famous for their recommendation systems and each service takes a unique approach to recommending and personalize content. While most users are happy with the recommendations provided, there are a section of users who are curious how and why a certain track is recommended. Complex recommendation systems take various factors like track metadata, user metadata, and play counts along with the track content itself. 

Inspired by Andrej Karpathy to build an own GPT, we have to use Language Models to build our own music recommendation system.

The emergence of ChatGPT has led to an exponential growth of prospects and implementations in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP). Various teams were struck with FOMO (Fear of Missing Out) and hastened to incorporate Large Language Models (LLMs) into their products. By using OpenAI models (text-curie-001, davinci, gpt-3.5-turbo), we successfully integrated them into our production on March 2, granting our users the ability to receive text summaries in their email reports and comprehend the essence of any article within our application. Three weeks later, we trained our own large language model for the same purpose. This talk will delve into our journey, exploring the lessons and insights gleaned from our hands-on experience with these cutting-edge tools.

https://ep2023.europython.eu/session/a-brief-history-of-data-storage

For millennia, humans have known things. Pretty quickly, we started writing them down; our brains aren't very good at storing all the things we know reliably, and we needed something more durable.

A long time ago, this meant clay tablets with cuneiform on them, and things have only got more complicated from there. Nowadays, we try to store data so that computers can understand it too, and that's given us a bewildering array of options - portable hard drives, magnetic tape storage and so much more.

In this talk, we'll take a look at the history of data storage, and discuss why some methods have worked better than others. We'll talk about why writing things down for humans is different than doing it for computers, and why it's difficult to do both at the same time (this is what code is). Finally, we'll look at today's state-of-the-art for keeping data safe, and discuss what the future might hold.

This talk has no prerequisites, although a fondness for weird facts will help!

The Internet of Things has been flourishing for many years, and Python has been playing an important role on the “easy to automate” topic for many devices. One of the challenges for the next generation ML is to think small, you read that right “thinking small”. It’s time to start being able to have mechanisms with super well-trained ML models in small-devices: ML on Microcontrollers. We are going to dive into TinyML and evaluate different setups to interact with sensors on microcontrollers. We will discuss the different hardware options and frameworks to start with, while checking different use cases that TinyML can solve, like: agriculture, conservation, health issues detection, ecology monitoring etc. In this talk, you will learn about Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML), which is an approach that explores machine learning to be deployed in embedded systems that enable run ML on microcontrollers. Lastly, we will discuss real use-cases and a practical case that could be implemented at home

https://ep2023.europython.eu/session/generative-ai-beyond-technicalities-an-ethical-perspective

Machines have become smarter than ever before. Recently, we have started using computers for solving problems beyond computations, and it might not be wrong to call them electronic creators. The future laptop might have a prompt based word application, replacing the current Word, where one has to type their thoughts and formulate an entire document from  scratch. Similarly, we might see a prompt based Paint application, instead of the typical Paint program, that generates the paintings for us. In my opinion, AI-based applications are not in fiction anymore, and we may soon be using them on our computers. However, there is a possibilty that the Generative AI can be potentially harmful for society. We need to explore the ethical concerns, and how the AI can impact our society. In this talk, we will try to understand how Generative AI is becoming a part of our future and how we can use it in a responsible and ethical manner.

[ *CORRECTIONS FROM THE SPEAKER* ]: 
When talking about two of the slides in the video, I say *""topic""* when I should have said *""partition"".* Below is the text as it should be - the highlighted words are what I should have said.
🔷 At 7:14 -  slide  *Multiple partitions, consumer groups:* 
🔹Sometimes that's not what you want. Sometimes you want your consumers to share the reading, so here we've got two *partitions,*  one with 1, 2, 3 and one with b, c, d in it.
🔹The producers [...] can choose which partition by hand, say I want *partition* one, two, three, or you can say here is a key, choose by the key which *partition* to go to.
🔹The consumers at the top right are in the same consumer group, they said ""we want to share consuming the *topic"".* 
🔹Each consumer will get one or more *partitions,*  but they won't both see the same *partitions.*  So one of them is seeing 1, 2, 3 and the other is seeing b, c, d. The bottom consumer is not in a consumer group, it's entirely independent, and like the previous consumers it's just getting all the messages in order.

🔷 At 14:43  -  slide *Three tills:* 
🔹So now we're going to add three producers and we'll add three *partitions,*  because then we can say each till will send to a separate *partition.*  The food preparer is still reading from all of them so it will get things interleaved nicely.

How did we do that? And how are we going to make 3.12 and following releases even faster?

 In this talk, I will present a high level overview of the approach we are taking to speeding up CPython. Starting with a simple overview of some basic principles, I will show how we can apply those to streamline and speedup CPython. I will try to avoid computer science and software engineering terminology, in favor of diagrams, a few simple examples, and some high-school math. Finally, I make some estimates about how much faster the next few releases of CPython will be, and how much faster Python could go.

40,What a screen reader can teach you about remote Python debugging — Ramón Corominas,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVu_3azaflM,fVu_3azaflM,EuroPython Conference,@EuroPythonConference,https://www.youtube.com/@EuroPythonConference,20230919,3892,142,2,,"europython,python,conference",Science & Technology,"[EuroPython 2023 — South Hall 2A on 2023-07-21]
https://ep2023.europython.eu/session/what-a-screen-reader-can-teach-you-about-remote-python-debugging

The NVDA screen reader is a Python application packaged with Py2exe, along with C++ extensions for low-level system access and improved performance. Its functionality can be expanded through addons that are also written in Python, which makes the ability to debug both the core and addon code highly desirable.

However, debugging code within an embedded or packaged Python environment can be quite challenging, especially if you are a visually impaired programmer trying to debug your own screen reader, since hitting a breakpoint will freeze the tool you rely on for computer access!

In this presentation, I will demonstrate how I addressed this challenge by leveraging Microsoft's debugpy library for remote debugging. I will showcase how this technique can be used to debug Python applications running within an embedded Python environment, regardless of the host language. Additionally, I will explore its applicability in debugging applications running on different operating systems or environments than the one where you prefer to use your debugging IDE.

Beautiful is better than ugly.

The frontier of AI Language Models awaits exploration.

 We, Pythonistas, face choices on how to use these tools.

Advanced models like GPT-4, BARD, and LLaMa generate human-like responses.

The nature of Language Models is fear,

But tools like TransformerLens show The Way.

Understanding The Model is possible.

The nature of Language Models is excitement.

Using them out of the box is one option.

Prompt engineering is another.

ChatGPT plugins and LangChain offer a third choice.

Fine-tuning them presents a fourth.

Training them from scratch is the fifth option.

Not using them at all is the final option. It may be safer.

The output for one LM is the prompt for another.

While openai is an excellent library, and

LangChain composes language models and utilities.

GPT's plugin system also composes language models and utilities, and

There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.

At the Netherlands Forensic Institute (NFI), we've developed a Python-based deep learning model to spot life-threatening messages in lawfully intercepted communication data, like those from the infamous chat service Encrochat.

Thanks to the application of our model in collaboration with the Dutch Police, dozens of potential victims of violent crimes, including murder, serious assault, and kidnapping, have been warned and safeguarded. In this talk, we'll dive into the development, implementation, and success of our deep learning model in the fight against violent criminal activities. We'll also tackle the risks tied to using deep learning for these cases and discuss the precautions we took to ensure responsible and accurate use.

Are you tired of struggling with memory management in Python? Do you want to take your skills to the next level and achieve maximum performance while minimising memory usage? Look no further, here is Zero-Copy in Python!
Zero-copy is a technique in computer programming that allows data to be transferred between different parts of a program without being copied to intermediate buffers. In Python, this technique can be achieved using the memory view object, which provides a view into the memory of other objects. Learn how to efficiently manipulate large datasets and optimise your code with the help of this powerful tool. Whether you're working with sockets, objects or memory profiling, memory view is your key to faster and more efficient Python programming.

Ever seen a code base where understanding a simple method meant jumping through tangled class hierarchies? We all have! And while ""Favor composition over inheritance!"" is almost as old as object-oriented programming, strictly avoiding all types of subclassing leads to verbose, un-Pythonic code. So, what to do?

The discussion on composition vs. inheritance is so frustrating because far-reaching design decisions like this can only be made with the ecosystem in mind – and because there's more than one type of subclassing!

Let's take a dogma-free stroll through the types of subclassing through a Pythonic lens and untangle some patterns and trade-offs together. By the end, you'll be more confident in deciding when subclassing will make your code more Pythonic and when composition will improve its clarity.

As Bloomberg’s infrastructure grows and evolves, the tools we use to manage it are becoming increasingly important. To streamline infrastructure management, our team set out to design a REST API and constituent CLI (Command Line Interface) that would comprise a single interface for both programmatic and human interaction with our infrastructure. Traditionally, building a CLI that is tightly coupled to an API requires maintaining a separate codebase, which is tedious and error-prone. Instead, we designed a CLI that dynamically generates commands based on the OpenAPI JSON documentation. However, since APIs are designed for computer interaction, we designed our API to include the information needed to implement a human-friendly CLI. Leveraging Python, FastAPI, and numerous other open source projects, we built a stable, extensible tool that greatly improves how we interact with our infrastructure.

- Are prices of short-term rental apartments in your region similar? How similar are they, and at which distance do they tend to be correlated?
- Do you have access to a few air pollution measurements but must provide a smooth map over the whole area?
- Is your machine learning model based on remote sensing data from Earth Observation satellites, and do you want to include data sampled on Earth?
- Do you work with county-level socio-economic factors, but you want to get insights at a finer scale?

`if any(answer)`, then come and see what we can do with the `pyinterpolate` package designed exactly for spatial interpolation!

https://ep2023.europython.eu/session/pep-458-a-solution-not-only-for-pypi

[PEP 458](https://peps.python.org/pep-0458/) uses cryptographic signing on [PyPI](https://pypi.org) to protect Python packages against attackers. The implementation of the PEP inspired the [Repository Service for TUF (RSTUF)](http://repository-service-tuf.readthedocs.io/), a project [accepted into the OpenSSF sandbox](https://github.com/ossf/tac/pull/137). We identified that the design could benefit other organizations and repositories looking to secure their software supply chains.
In this talk we would answer the following questions: 
- How did the PEP 458 design help to start the Repository Service for TUF (RSTUF)?
- How could RSTUF be used for PyPI with its millions of packages?
- How can RSTUF be deployed by any organization at any scale without requiring TUF expertise?

Additionally, in this talk, we would give an overview of PEP 458, how it works, and give a high-level overview of TUF.

Django and Python make fullstack and API web projects a breeze. But as Python has matured, significant tooling has risen to improve the development experience (DX). Can you use this tooling, in a modern editor and IDE, to stay in the flow and make your development…joyful?

In this session we’ll put PyCharm to work, at helping us work. Navigation, refactoring, autocomplete – the usual suspects. We’ll also see “test-first” development to stay in the IDE, plus how this can apply to frontends.

Pytorch is one of the most popular machine learning frameworks, and its latest iteration (PyTorch 2.0) landed just a couple of days back. Among other things, PyTorch 2.0 offers faster performance with a fully backward-compatible API that guarantees the development ergonomics that PyTorch is known for. 

In this talk, we will examine how practitioners (researchers and engineers) can benefit from optimizations provided by PyTorch 2.0 and what other improvements are on the horizon.

https://ep2023.europython.eu/session/private-data-anonymization-with-python-fundamentals

How to bring large legal document repositories into the public domain without releasing private data? The fundamental concepts behind document anonymization are entity recognition, masking type, and pseudoanonymization. Using python language and a collection of libraries such as spacy, pytorch, and others we can achieve good scores of anonymization. How is this applied within a flow containing AI models for NER? Once anonymized how to improve the result by doing more text mining with python based apps and human in the loop. Although it was approved in 2016, the application of the GDPR at the European level remains a challenge in banking, legal, and other contexts. This talk covers the process of transforming pdf and docx documents into xml, processing them using regexp and spacy/torch models, and how to parse these results using AntConc and Textacy. All the ideas will be supported with the real experience of the MAPA project a European project for anonymization finished in 2022.

[Dirty Equals](https://github.com/samuelcolvin/dirty-equals) is a new python library by Samuel Colvin, the creator of Pydantic. It will transform how you write tests, especially for APIs. 

I made some contributions to it, which forever changed how I thought about `NotImplemented`. I thought it was a placeholder for unfinished work and unexpected use cases. I thought the language quirks it created in equality comparison were annoying. 

But in **DirtyEquals**, it’s a magic way to transform Python’s built in equality operator... And that changed how I think about language quirks, full stop.

How to get familiar with codebase you need to maintain with minimum suffering? How to leave codebase easier to deal with for your colleagues so they don’t have to suffer like you did?

If you are experienced developer or a junior just starting your journey, inheriting codebase can be a very challenging task. Especially if the codebase is not quite up to your standards, or it’s just huge and complex beast.

I will convey my experience and tips and tricks on inheriting code I acquired during 12 years of software development on new and old projects.

The talk will provide guidelines to ease taking over code from somebody else, as well as remind developers of the importance that planning, preparation and documentation have in facilitating code change and project growth.

Magic happens every time you take your phone out of your pocket. Somehow, just by looking at the screen, your phone recognizes you (and only you) and magically unlocks.

Have you ever stopped for a minute and thought to yourself - How does that even work? And maybe more importantly, how secure is it?

In this session, we're going to understand how facial recognition works under the hood. We'll dive into some potential security problems, and we'll show you how we were able to break into a biometric database built on the Dlib-python-library by applying a sophisticated brute-force attack. The results will surprise you.

Recently, most works focus on synthesizing independent images, while for real-world applications, it is common and necessary to generate a series of coherent images for story-telling. In this work, we mainly focus on story visualization and continuation tasks and propose AR-LDM, a latent diffusion model auto-regressively conditioned on history captions and generated images. To my best knowledge, this is the first work successfully leveraging diffusion models for coherent visual story synthesizing.

https://ep2023.europython.eu/session/poisoned-pickles-make-you-ill

Don’t you love pickles? In the data science space, the pickle module has become one of the most popular ways to serialise and distribute machine learning models - yet, pickles introduce a wide range of problems. For starters, it is incredibly easy to poison a pickle. Once this happens, a poisoned pickle can be used by an attacker to inject any arbitrary code into your ML pipelines. And what’s even worse: it’s incredibly hard to detect if a pickle has been poisoned!

Good news? Help is on the way! You now have access to an increasing number of tools to help you generate higher-quality pickles. And when those are not enough, you can always draw inspiration from the DevOps movement and their trust-or-discard processes.

This talk will show you how widespread pickles are and how easy it is to poison models serialised with pickle, but also how easy it is to start protecting them from attacks.

Controllers deal with numbers all day long. They have to check a lot of data from different sources. Often the reports contain erroneous or missing data. Identifying outliers and suspicious data is time-consuming. 

This presentation will introduce a Small Data Problem-End2End workflow using statistical tools and machine learning to make controllers' jobs easier and help them be more productive.

We will demonstrate how we used amongst others, 
- [scipy](https://scipy.org/)
- [pandera](https://pandera.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
- [dirty cat](https://dirty-cat.github.io/stable/)
- [nltk](https://www.nltk.org/)
- [fastnumbers](https://pypi.org/project/fastnumbers/)
to create a self-improving system to automate the screening of reports and report outliers in advance so that they can be eliminated more quickly.

https://ep2023.europython.eu/session/high-volume-pdf-text-extraction-using-python-open-source-tools

All major companies have huge amounts of (mostly PDF) documents that contain important - even critically important - information, that does no longer exist anywhere else in their data stores.

Reports, once generated for shareholders and legal or financial authorities, may still be useful for developing longterm forecasts or triggering company management decisions.

By definition, documents are intended for human perception, and as such contain unstructured data from an information technology perspective.

Therefore, tools to extract PDF text content (mostly, but not only text) from millions of pages have become important vehicles to recreate structured information.

This presentation talks about extraction ""need for speed"" in this Big Data scenario, the need for integration with OCR capabilities and presents an open-source toolset which combines both, top-of-the-class performance and maximum extraction detail.

https://ep2023.europython.eu/session/the-pythons-stability-promise

Many modules you use and love have a portion of their implementation written in other languages, and for that a Python extension need to be made.
Python offers a C-API that allow people extending the language, and being a nice glue-language, C is also a bridge to many other languages as well.

So if everything is simple, what's the deal with stability?
Changes in the C-API might break the functionality in older versions, so PEP 387 saves the day with a policy for backward compatibility.
Starting from Python 3.2, the Limited API was introduced, which defined a subset of Python's C-API that it's promised that if used, the code can be compiled in one version, and run in many others as well.

Also, having a Stable ABI compatible wheel, allow you to only have one-wheel-per-OS, and not one-wheel-per-python-version, which can simplify your release process.

This talk will introduce the Limited API concept, and provide the necessary information to include it in your project.

As our understanding of the Universe is expanding, the desire to model the physics that govern cosmic evolution is more evident than ever, driving the emergence of cosmological simulations that model the Universe from the beginning of time till present day. In combination with Machine Learning, they allow for an unprecedented capability; one can train AI models on simulations, where the evolution history of galaxies is available, that can in turn be applied on real galaxies. In this work, we propose the use of Python as a ML tool, through the popular library Tensorflow, to quantify the impact of different cosmological models on the derivation of the history of galaxies. Python accompanies us at every step of the way, from creating the datasets and training the probabilistic neural networks to the visualization of the results, as we attempt to shed light on the cosmic past of galaxies, surpassing the unshakeable reality that we can only observe them at a specific moment in time.

https://ep2023.europython.eu/session/working-in-units-how-to-decouple-the-database-and-domain-layers-in-python

A crucial element of architecting a software application for scale is the collaboration of domain experts and developers. For that to happen, the application must separate the domain layer— where elements that represent the real world reside—from the infrastructure layer—where these elements are translated into precise software processes.

Within the Fintech team at Kiwi.com, we are rearchitecting a critical service to accept more payment providers. As part of this refactor, we are adopting the Unit of Work pattern to disentangle domain entities from the database processes that represent them. This way, domain experts can share their knowledge with developers more easily, and developers can find opportunities for optimization without the involvement of domain experts in the process.

Attendees will gain a solid understanding of how to implement the UoW pattern in their Python applications, how it fits into the broader context of DDD, and how to prepare their code for future growth.

eBPF is a amazing technology that can run sandboxed programs in a privileged context such as the operating system kernel. But are eBPF programs limited to the operating system kernel? eBPF programs have fast access to resources like memory. These programs can access the memory of running Python applications very faster, allowing you to instrument Python processes with low overhead!

In my presentation, I will show how Python's internal structure supports instrumentation through the use of eBPF. Following that, we'll experiment with eBPF and other modern techniques to instrumenting the Python applications. I'll explain explain why eBPF is more appropriate and efficient technology for instrumentation. By the end of the session, we will have developed an eBPF-based simple tracing tool for instrumenting Python applications.

After this presentation, you will better understand how eBPF can help you in the instrumentation of Python applications.

101,Python Linters at Scale — Jimmy Lai,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ihC3frDxss,-ihC3frDxss,EuroPython Conference,@EuroPythonConference,https://www.youtube.com/@EuroPythonConference,20230919,1759,205,6,,"europython,python,conference",Science & Technology,"[EuroPython 2023 — Terrace 2B on 2023-07-19]
https://ep2023.europython.eu/session/python-linters-at-scale

Black, Flake8, isort, and Mypy are useful Python linters but it’s challenging to use them effectively at scale in the case of multiple codebases, in a large codebase, or with many developers. Linter analysis on large codebases is slow. Linters may slow down developers by asking them to fix trivial issues. Running linters in distributed CI jobs makes it hard to understand the overall developer experience.

In this talk, we'll walk you through solving those scaling problems using a reusable linter framework that releases new linter updates automatically, reuses consistent configurations, runs linters on only updated code to speedup runtime, collects logs and metrics to provide observability, and builds auto fixes for common linter issues. Our linter runs are fast and scalable. Every week, they run 10k times on multiple millions of lines of code in over 25 codebases, generating 25k suggestions for more than 200 developers. Its autofixes also save 20 hours of developer time every week.

https://ep2023.europython.eu/session/games-of-life-generative-art-in-python

We're entering the age of machine-generated art. Many of the new systems are shockingly impressive but impossible to replicate by individuals because they rely on complex machine learning techniques with huge datasets that aren't feasible to do in a home environment. Fortunately, there's an entire group of clever approaches to generate graphics that look cohesive, unique, and deliberate... and that you can easily do on your own computer.

In this short talk we'll go through a few of those algorithms like Clifford attractors, slime mold simulation, and reduction of source imagery to geometric primitives. We'll generate images and animations, we'll dabble in 2D and 3D. You'll leave the talk with your own ideas how to create attractive visualizations out of thin air. The talk assumes familiarity with Python and high-school math.

Python packaging is quickly evolving and new tools pop up on a regular basis. Lots of talks and posts on packaging exist but none of them give a structured, unbiased overview of the available tools.

This talk will shed light on the jungle of packaging and environment management tools, comparing them on a basis of predefined features.

Apache Arrow, and its Python library PyArrow are becoming the standard de facto for transfering data and interoperability between libraries and languages. As more compute engines, storages and databases start to speak arrow, you might be relying on it without even knowing.
The same transformation is happening with Substrait, that is on track to be the standard representation of query plans themselves. Allowing queries to be routed to different engines as far as they speak substrait, or even decomposed and forwarded to different engines.
This talk we will provide a quick introduction to the Arrow ecosystem, showing to Python developers how libraries like Pandas, Polars and PyArrow itself leverage Arrow and how compute engines like Velox, Datafusion and Acero are embracing Arrow and Substrait.
The talk will also show how a basic database system based on Arrow and Substrait can be built with a minimum amount of code thanks to all the foundations they provide.

If you're like me, then you've long known about Python's ""logging"" module, but you've ignored it because it seemed too complex. In this talk, I'll show you that ""logging"" is easy to learn and use, giving you far more flexibility than you can get from inserting calls to ""print"" all over your code. I'll show you how you can start to use ""logging"" right away -- but also how you can use it to create a sophisticated logging system that sends different types of output to different destinations. After this talk, you'll know how to use ""logging"", and you'll be less likely to use ""print"" in your applications.

Interactive control of robots can be a challenge, as it requires a lot of things to happen in parallel while at the same time reacting to data from sensors and control signals. Using python's async facilities may greatly simplify this task, allowing us to write code that is similar to the non-parallel version, but that is at the same time easy to compose into bigger program doing many things at once. I will talk about my own experiences programming the Fluffbug robot with CircuitPython, point out the problems and the solutions I found.

https://ep2023.europython.eu/session/using-nlp-to-detect-knots-in-protein-structures

Proteins are essential components of our bodies, with their function often dependent on their 3D structure. However, uncovering the 3D structure has for a long time been redeemed by months of hard work in the lab. Recent advances in Machine learning and Natural language processing have made it possible to build models (eg. AlphaFold) capable of predicting the protein's 3D structure with the same precision as experimental methods.

In this talk, I will explore an even more specific application of language models for proteins - the detection of a knot in a protein's 3D structure solely from the protein amino acid sequence. Knotting in proteins is a phenomenon that can affect their function and stability. Thanks to NLP and interpretation techniques we can try to uncover why and how proteins tie themself into a knot. In this research, we rely on many Python-based tools starting from Biopython to Pymol and Hugging Face transformer library.

A Jupyter notebook is quite handy for rapid REPL (Read-Eval-Print-Loop) style tasks such as exploratory data analysis and data science. However, we would feel deficiencies in proper SW engineering supports at some point as the notebook grows to have larger and more complicated code. It is because the Jupyter notebook lacks several important features including code sharing, refactoring support, version control and advanced editing. Fortunately, traditional full-fledged IDEs, such as _VS Code_ or _PyCharm,_ are available at hand and they support these lacking features very well. Then, why don’t we take advantage of the best of both worlds?

In this beginner-level hands-on talk, I will demonstrate how to transform Jupyter notebook workflows to a proper Python package using _VS Code._ I will also introduce several basic but essential refactoring recommendations. By doing so, you can use the package for several notebooks and even share with your colleagues and friends.

Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown some impressive capabilities and their impact is the topic of the moment. What will the future look like? Are we going to only talk to bots? Will prompting replace programming? Or are we just hyping up unreliable parrots and burning money? In this talk, I'll present visions for NLP in the age of LLMs and a pragmatic, practical approach for how to use Large Language Models to ship more successful NLP projects from prototype to production today.

Testing is a crucial part of the software development process. But, with so many testing techniques available, it can be challenging to know which one to use. While unit testing is a popular technique, it's not always the most effective or efficient way to ensure software quality. In this talk, we’ll explore spec-based testing, a technique that focuses on verifying that the software behaves in accordance with its specifications or requirements.

https://ep2023.europython.eu/session/spiral-python

Most introductory Python books and online resources like w3schools.com try to be complete when a new concept is explained. This does not always work well for beginners. E.g. if you have just grasped how a while-loop  works, it may cause too much cognitive load to also understand the break and continue options, let alone the else clause.

The learning psychologist Jerome Bruner introduced the term ""spiral learning"". The idea is that you don't teach all aspects of a new concept, but just enough to use it. At a later stage a teacher can revisit the subject and explain more details, when a student needs this to take the next step.

Spiral Python is a road map of subjects that can be found in any introductory book or online resource about Python, but absolutely original in the sense that it takes into account how people learn in a natural way. You do not need to know the whole language before you can use it. Spiral Python also contains exercises (to practice) and challenges (to motivate).

https://ep2023.europython.eu/session/the-needle-and-the-haystack-visualizing-single-datapoints-out-of-billions

Python tools like Bokeh and Dash let you build custom Web-based interactive visualization apps and dashboards.  While these solutions work well to visualize megabyte-sized datasets, web technologies struggle to render gigabyte or larger datasets efficiently, because they transfer all the data into the client browser. Pre-rendering the data on the server using a tool like Datashader can visualize such large datasets efficiently, but the resulting static renderings make exploring individual datapoints difficult.

This talk demonstrates how the HoloViz ecosystem of tools (holoviz.org) allows you to run exploratory notebooks and build dashboards that do server-side rendering of billions of data points without losing the ability to interactively inspect and annotate individual samples in the browser.

In this talk, we will present DuckDB. DuckDB is a novel data management system that executes analytical SQL queries without requiring a server. DuckDB has a unique, in-depth integration with the existing PyData ecosystem. This integration allows DuckDB to query and output data from and to other Python libraries without copying it. This makes DuckDB an essential tool for the data scientist. In a live demo, we will showcase how DuckDB performs and integrates with the most used Python data-wrangling tool, Pandas. 
Besides learning about DuckDB's main charactestics, users will also experience a live demo of DuckDB and Pandas in a typical data science scenario, focusing on comparing their performance and usability while showcasing their cooperation. The demo is most interesting for an audience familiar with Python, the Pandas API, and SQL.

This talk discusses asyncio, an essential tool for asynchronous, non-blocking code in Python, and its limitations, such as non-durability and inability to distribute across multiple machines. Temporal.io, an open-source microservice orchestration platform, is introduced as a robust solution capable of using event sourcing for durability, scalability, and resilience, effectively managing system failures. Temporal based asyncio event loop implementation adds seamless durability to Python code. The complete state of the program, including local variables and await calls, is fully preserved across process and other infra failures. We highlight real-world applications and conclude by emphasizing how Temporal transforms the design and implementation of distributed fault-tolerant systems.

https://ep2023.europython.eu/session/hpy-the-future-of-python-native-extensions

Updating Python versions often forces us to update native extensions at the
same time. But what if you need to update Python because of a security issue,
but cannot (yet) move to a newer version of a dependency? Or you are running a
proprietary binary extension that cannot easily be recompiled?

The HPy project provides a better C extension API for Python. It compiles to
binaries that work across all versions of CPython, PyPy, GraalPy. HPy makes
porting from the existing C API easy and its design ensures that the binaries
we produce today stay binary compatible with future Python versions.

NumPy is the single largest direct user of the CPython C API we know of. After
over 2 years of work and more than 30k lines of code ported, we can demonstrate
NumPy running its tests and benchmarks with HPy. We will show the same NumPy
binary run on multiple CPython versions and GraalPy. And we will discuss
performance characteristics of this port across CPython, GraalPy, and PyPy.

A fully typed code base requires less test code to achieve the same level of confidence in its correctness. We'll analyze specific code examples and see how dependent types and exhaustiveness checking make certain classes of tests obsolete.

142,Apache Spark vs cloud-native SQL engines — Franz Wöllert,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHNOLfUDBZQ,vHNOLfUDBZQ,EuroPython Conference,@EuroPythonConference,https://www.youtube.com/@EuroPythonConference,20230919,2466,387,8,,"europython,python,conference",Science & Technology,"[EuroPython 2023 — North Hall on 2023-07-19]
https://ep2023.europython.eu/session/apache-spark-vs-cloud-native-sql-engines

Currently, SQL and Cloud Data Warehouses (DWH) are extremely popular for good reason. They are great for dashboarding and business intelligence (BI) use cases due to their ease-of-use. However, their combination might not be the best choice for every problem. More precisely, business-critical data pipelines with high complexity might be better suited for frameworks such as Apache Spark which greatly benefit from the tight integration with general purpose languages like Python (e.g., PySpark). 

Expect an opinionated comparison between Apache Spark and seemingly easier-to-use cloud native SQL engines. By the end of this talk, you will be challenged to think about why they are complementary and when each has its justification.

Distributed databases are widely used in modern applications for their high availability and scalability. Have you ever wondered how data integrity is maintained with the data across multiple nodes? One of the key components of achieving this is distributed consensus. Raft is a widely used consensus algorithm that provides a fault-tolerant and highly available system. In this talk, we will explore how to implement Raft consensus using the rqlite distributed database in python.

https://ep2023.europython.eu/session/rust-for-python-data-engineers

Python is a popular language for data engineering but has some limitations in performance, concurrency, and production deployments. The Rust programming language offers powerful alternatives with strong compile-time and memory safety guarantees. In this talk, I'll explore how data engineers can leverage Rust to build high-performance data pipelines and processing systems. I'll cover the Rust ecosystem for data work, including frameworks and libraries for working with data formats, databases, streaming systems, and scientific computing. By combining Rust and Python, data engineers can harness the benefits of both languages and build robust end-to-end data systems that scale to meet demanding production needs.

https://ep2023.europython.eu/session/adding-zero-downtime-migrations-strategy-in-a-saas-project

Zero-downtime migration is a technique for running database migrations without stopping the web app. As clients' databases grow larger, applying necessary updates to the database can become time-consuming or potentially break the database schema. This talk will describe problematic operation types and provide a strategy for writing and running migrations to release new software versions without downtime.
