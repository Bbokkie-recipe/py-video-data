        "description": "Speaker:: Jessica Greene (she/her) Vanessa Aguilar\n“We know what your app did last summer. Do you? Observing Python applications using Prometheus.”\n\nTrack: PyCon: DevOps\nWhen your service is running in production do you know if it's performing as intended? How can you know if latency for requests is higher than expected, debug memory consumption or get alerted on certain behaviors?\nWe call this type of insight observability and the concept is built on three pillars: Metrics, Traces and Logs. In this workshop we will focus on the first pillar. We'll start by instrumenting a Python Web service with metrics using Prometheus and then display them in Grafana dashboards. Along the way we will also discuss why observability is important and what makes useful metrics.This workshop is aimed at those who already have some experience with engineering and building applications in containers using Docker. To participate in the workshop you will be required to have Python 3, Python Poetry and Docker running on your machine. \nAs Site Reliability and Backend engineers, we greatly enjoy the synergy that is required between us in order to operate the applications we write and the platforms they run on. Our individual roles enable us to approach the topic from different perspectives and we will also discuss how this shared responsibility is built into our engineering culture.\nBy the end of the session you will have a grasp of the key concepts for instrumenting a service and understanding what to monitor. Get ready to start adding metrics to your own services!\nRecorded at the PyConDE & PyData Berlin 2022 conference, April 11-13 2022.\nhttps://2022.pycon.de\n\nMore details at the conference page: https://2022.pycon.de/program/RE89WX\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/pydataberlin\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/pyconde",

In this talk we will dive into the inner workings of some of Python’s most commonly used frameworks. Then by looking into their underlying runtimes we will compare ASGIs and WSGIs. We will use FastAPI as a source of inspiration to see what modern web frameworks can offer and what are the tradeoffs with comparison to the more commonly used ones such as Flask. Finally we will get to mention alternatives with slightly different approaches in this space such as Tornado.\n\n\nRecorded at the PyConDE & PyData Berlin 2022 conference, April 11-13 2022.\nhttps://2022.pycon.de\nMore details at the conference page: https://2022.pycon.de/program/EQSRNN\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/pydataberlin\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/pyconde",

Whether you want to start contributing or just want to get a better understanding of Python by exploring its source code, it’s often difficult to know where to start or what you’re missing.\r\n\r\nIn my talk, I will show you around the CPython source code by implementing a new operator, a pipe operator. While doing so, I will discuss core parts of the internals, such as Python’s grammar, its syntax trees, and the underlying logic that will perform the operation. By the end, you will have a good idea of the moving parts involved in core language features.\r\n\r\nI will also take you through the steps necessary to make it all work. I’ll show you how I obtained a copy of the source code, regenerated the parser and token files, and how I compiled my modified version of CPython. I will also write and run tests to help me implement my changes. This should give you a mental framework that helps you while diving into more comprehensive resources, like the excellent [Python Developer’s Guide](https://devguide.python.org/).\r\n\r\nMy talk is aimed at everyone who wants to explore CPython’s internals. You don’t have to be an expert in Python, although some affinity with Python helps with understanding the internals. I will also use C to implement some of the operator logic, but knowledge of C is by no means required. In short, if you’re interested in diving into the CPython source code, this talk is for you.\n\n\nRecorded at the PyConDE & PyData Berlin 2022 conference, April 11-13 2022.\nhttps://2022.pycon.de\nMore details at the conference page: https://2022.pycon.de/program/7ZWBFV\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/pydataberlin\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/pyconde",

The positive impact of diversity and inclusion is no longer debatable. Although diversity and inclusion (D&I) offers clear benefits, it’s difficult to implement. A major issue is that many companies believe they’re already promoting a diverse and inclusive culture. However, only 40 percent of employees agree that their manager fosters an inclusive environment. A diverse and inclusive environment establishes a sense of belonging among employees. When employees feel more connected at work, they tend to work harder and smarter, producing higher quality work. As a result, organizations that adopt D&I practices see huge gains in the form of business results, innovation, and decision-making.\n\n\nRecorded at the PyConDE & PyData Berlin 2022 conference, April 11-13 2022.\nhttps://2022.pycon.de\nMore details at the conference page: https://2022.pycon.de/program/T8D89Z\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/pydataberlin\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/pyconde",

In this session I'll first show some examples of such situations, then share some coping strategies that I've successfully used to deal with them. I'll also share some things that everyone can do to help maintainers and open source communities in responding to negativity.\n\n\nRecorded at the PyConDE & PyData Berlin 2022 conference, April 11-13 2022.\nhttps://2022.pycon.de\nMore details at the conference page: https://2022.pycon.de/program/WPR7DK\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/pydataberlin\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/pyconde",

        "description": "Speaker:: Gajendra Deshpande\n\nTrack: PyCon: Django\nDjango is the most popular Python-based web framework used for creating web applications. The web applications are vulnerable for various reasons including a) configuration settings of the web applications b) lack of implementation of security best practices and secure coding and c) lack of awareness of secure first web applications among developers. The vulnerable web applications put the data of the customers at greater risk and the compromised code can lead to problems beyond control. It is very important to develop secure web applications to protect customer data and code to mitigate the risk. In this talk, we will focus on two aspects. First, performing penetration testing on Django web applications to identify vulnerabilities and scanning for Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) Top 10 risks. Second, strategies and configuration settings for making the source code and Django applications secure. We will also discuss the Djangohunter tool to identify incorrectly configured Django applications that are exposing sensitive information.\n\n\nRecorded at the PyConDE & PyData Berlin 2022 conference, April 11-13 2022.\nhttps://2022.pycon.de\nMore details at the conference page: https://2022.pycon.de/program/8MWCQG\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/pydataberlin\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/pyconde",
