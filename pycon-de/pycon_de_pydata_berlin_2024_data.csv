🎓 Watch Maxim Danilov discuss how uDjango transforms Django into an asynchronous microservices framework with simplicity and speed at its core.

Speakers:
Maxim Danilov

Description:
Maxim Danilov, a Software Architect and Senior Python Developer, presented on transforming Django into a microservice-oriented async framework in his talk. By using a single file Django project, developers can create asynchronous microservices with ease. The concept of lightweight Django projects has been around for a while, initially appearing in the book ""Lightweight Django"" in 2014. However, it wasn't until Django introduced ASGI in 2022 that it became viable for microservices.

Danilov discussed the benefits of Django microservices, such as the all-in-one package, standard architecture, and rapid development speed. He also highlighted challenges faced, including misconceptions about Django's suitability for microservices, issues with settings.py, and concerns about URL routing and performance.

The talk aimed to educate the audience about uDjango, a technology for building synchronous and asynchronous microservices using one or two files. Drawing inspiration from various industry experts and projects, Danilov emphasized the simplicity and efficiency of using uDjango for high-performance microservices.

🎓 Watch how Matthieu Amiguet transforms a complex callback mess into a readable and efficient system using generators in computer-assisted live music.

Speakers:
Matthieu Amiguet

Description:
In a fascinating talk titled ""Replacing Callbacks with Generators: A Case Study in Computer-Assisted Live Music,"" Matthieu Amiguet, a musician and mathematician turned developer, shared insights based on his work at Les Chemins de Traverse. The collective, which focuses on sonic exploration and live performance, dived into the challenges faced in developing an interactive realtime audio processing system for live music performances. They found that the use of callbacks, although commonly employed in programming, became burdensome in this context.

Amiguet detailed how they streamlined their system by implementing a thin abstraction layer, replacing complex callback structures with more readable generators. By utilizing generators, which yield results instead of the traditional return method, they were able to enhance the efficiency and clarity of their code significantly.

At Les Chemins de Traverse, they blend different musical styles and techniques, creating a unique sonic experience. By leveraging tools like Olivier Bélanger's pyo module for realtime audio processing, they aim to augment traditional acoustical instruments with computer-generated sounds, adding a new dimension to live music performances.

Through their experience, Amiguet showcased how a thoughtful abstraction layer can simplify code, enabling a more focused approach to music production rather than getting entangled in technical complexities. While their case study is music-specific, the principles they applied can be adapted to various scenarios where callbacks lead to convoluted and cumbersome code structures.

🎓 Watch as Johannes Bechberger dives into Python 3.12's groundbreaking monitoring and debugging API, revolutionizing the way you develop tools and debug with ease!

Speakers:
Johannes Bechberger

Description:
Johannes Bechberger, a Software Engineer at SAP, presented a talk on Python 3.12's latest monitoring and debugging API. The new low-impact monitoring API, introduced through PEP669, enables the development of faster debuggers than ever before. Historically lacking a robust monitoring and profiling API, Python previously relied on the sys.settrace API, which was inefficient and lacked configurability. The new monitoring API, launched in October 2023, provides a well-designed, fine-tuned alternative that significantly improves commonly used operations. During the talk, attendees gained insights into the API's key features and design decisions, learning how to leverage it to create efficient tools such as simple debuggers. Johannes Bechberger's expertise in JVM development and his proficiency in Python, cultivated over nearly a decade, made him a compelling speaker on this advanced technological subject.

Speakers:
Jens Nie

Description:
Jens Nie, a physicist turned developer at Rosenxt, presented at AsyncApp. He discussed the increasing use of asyncio in Python but noted it's not the default choice for all projects, especially by beginners. Jens shared his journey creating simple yet powerful asyncio-based applications using lightweight and attractive patterns. 

Asyncio addresses I/O performance problems by preventing code from blocking concurrent elements in an application. While traditional methods like threading and multiprocessing can be complex, asyncio offers a simpler abstraction layer. Jens emphasized that proper threading and multiprocessing require a deep understanding and are often topics for experts. 

To showcase asyncio's efficiency, Jens demonstrated building blocks for creating a Raspberry Pi monitoring app. This app gathers sensor readings, logs them, stores data, and tracks CPU and memory usage. It can be configured through various methods and follows the UNIX philosophy of focusing on specific tasks. With asyncio, Jens highlighted the ease of developing effective applications without intricate knowledge of underlying processes.
