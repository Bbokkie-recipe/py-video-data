This talk will show how compiling your Python code with Cython (https://cython.org/) enables you to make direct use of fast and memory efficient native data types and data structures. Cython provides very efficient ways to access the internals of Python data structures, process data from NumPy arrays, and use data structures from native C libraries or the C++ STL standard library as replacements for the high-level Python collections.

PyLadies Mission is to advance a diverse Python Community. This work is done by many volunteers in PyLadies chapters around the world, and here in Germany. And the benefits of this work are often felt far beyond the community itself. 

Pyladies Germany currently has four chapters: Berlin, Hamburg, Karlsruhe, and Munich. Each working to support underrepresented people in our community, so they can thrive. They work to create safe spaces for learning and networking. 

Join this panel to learn more about how these volunteers and organizers make a difference, what they would like the wider python community to understand, so they could be more effective in their work, and what you could do tomorrow, to help advance this work.

In this tutorial, you will refactor a space travel text adventure.
Starting with a working but messy program, you will improve the structure of the code.
You will identify redundant code segments, split long functions into shorter ones, extract data structures and encapsulate behavior into classes. The outcome will be a program that is more readable, easier to maintain, and, hopefully, still works.

The tutorial will be delivered as a guided tour with many hands-on exercises.
Together, we collect strategies that can be applied to Python projects that grow bigger and bigger.
The refactoring tutorial is suitable for junior Python developers.

“We know what your app did last summer. Do you? Observing Python applications using Prometheus.”

Track: PyCon: DevOps
When your service is running in production do you know if it's performing as intended? How can you know if latency for requests is higher than expected, debug memory consumption or get alerted on certain behaviors?
We call this type of insight observability and the concept is built on three pillars: Metrics, Traces and Logs. In this workshop we will focus on the first pillar. We'll start by instrumenting a Python Web service with metrics using Prometheus and then display them in Grafana dashboards. Along the way we will also discuss why observability is important and what makes useful metrics.This workshop is aimed at those who already have some experience with engineering and building applications in containers using Docker. To participate in the workshop you will be required to have Python 3, Python Poetry and Docker running on your machine. 
As Site Reliability and Backend engineers, we greatly enjoy the synergy that is required between us in order to operate the applications we write and the platforms they run on. Our individual roles enable us to approach the topic from different perspectives and we will also discuss how this shared responsibility is built into our engineering culture.
By the end of the session you will have a grasp of the key concepts for instrumenting a service and understanding what to monitor. Get ready to start adding metrics to your own services!

How do web frameworks navigate the limitations of the  Python concurrency model? In this talk we will dive into the inner workings of some of Python’s most commonly used frameworks. Then by looking into their underlying runtimes we will compare ASGIs and WSGIs. We will use FastAPI as a source of inspiration to see what modern web frameworks can offer and what are the tradeoffs with comparison to the more commonly used ones such as Flask. Finally we will get to mention alternatives with slightly different approaches in this space such as Tornado.

Track: PyCon: Python Language
Diving into the CPython source code can feel daunting. Whether you want to start contributing or just want to get a better understanding of Python by exploring its source code, it’s often difficult to know where to start or what you’re missing.

In my talk, I will show you around the CPython source code by implementing a new operator, a pipe operator. While doing so, I will discuss core parts of the internals, such as Python’s grammar, its syntax trees, and the underlying logic that will perform the operation. By the end, you will have a good idea of the moving parts involved in core language features.

I will also take you through the steps necessary to make it all work. I’ll show you how I obtained a copy of the source code, regenerated the parser and token files, and how I compiled my modified version of CPython. I will also write and run tests to help me implement my changes. This should give you a mental framework that helps you while diving into more comprehensive resources, like the excellent [Python Developer’s Guide](https://devguide.python.org/).

My talk is aimed at everyone who wants to explore CPython’s internals. You don’t have to be an expert in Python, although some affinity with Python helps with understanding the internals. I will also use C to implement some of the operator logic, but knowledge of C is by no means required. In short, if you’re interested in diving into the CPython source code, this talk is for you.

Track: General: Community, Diversity, Carreer, Life and everything else
Let’s face it. The positive impact of diversity and inclusion is no longer debatable. Although diversity and inclusion (D&I) offers clear benefits, it’s difficult to implement. A major issue is that many companies believe they’re already promoting a diverse and inclusive culture. However, only 40 percent of employees agree that their manager fosters an inclusive environment. A diverse and inclusive environment establishes a sense of belonging among employees. When employees feel more connected at work, they tend to work harder and smarter, producing higher quality work. As a result, organizations that adopt D&I practices see huge gains in the form of business results, innovation, and decision-making.

Track: PyCon: Programming & Software Engineering
The aspect-oriented programming paradigm can support the separation of
cross-cutting concerns such as logging, caching, or checking of permissions.
This can improve code modularity and maintainability.
Python offers decorator to implement re-usable code for cross-cutting task.

This tutorial is an in-depth introduction to decorators.
It covers the usage of decorators and how to implement simple and more advanced
decorators.
Use cases demonstrate how to work with decorators.
In addition to showing how functions can use closures to create decorators,
the tutorial introduces callable class instance as alternative.
Class decorators can solve problems that use be to be tasks for metaclasses.
The tutorial provides uses cases for class decorators.

While the focus is on best practices and practical applications, the tutorial
also provides deeper insight into how Python works behind the scene.

On every computer I've had for the past 20 years, I've created a folder called ""stupid python tricks"".
It's where I put code that should never see the light of day.
Code that abuses advanced features like decorators, metaclasses, and dynamic typing to do terrible things.

Code I'm going to teach you.

Did you ever find yourself in one of the following situations?

* You hard-coded a parameter and now you really wish you could easily change it.
* A proper command line interface would be nice, but you are way too lazy to write a lot of code for it.
* You have a bunch of config files for different runs which only differ in a few entries.

In this talk, you'll learn how to easily manage the situations described above using the open-source library [jsonargparse](https://github.com/omni-us/jsonargparse).

If you are new to this topic, this talk can hopefully save you configuration-related frustrations in the future.
If you are already using the likes of click, fire, typer or hydra, you'll get to know some of jsonargparse's advanced features that your current tool might be missing.

Have you ever wondered how Django, SQLAlchemy, and PonyORM can translate Python objects into database rows? How complicated can this really be? In this talk we will be creating our own (limited) ORM from scratch, starting from almost nothing and finishing with a library that can define relational models, translate simple and (somewhat) complex queries into a database query, and create and apply migrations, all while hiding the details behind a Python interface.

Python is used for a wide variety of applications in data science, scientific computing, and other complex enterprise-level products. When building production-ready products, there is no way around using a suitable framework that triggers the different set of pipelines handling the dataflow. Nowadays, there is an enormous landscape of orchestration tools, making it easy to lose track of their various advantages and disadvantages. This talk will take a look at the current landscape of orchestration tools in Python. Specifically focusing on Kubeflow, Airflow and Prefect and which of them are best suited in terms of performance, usability, and effort of implementation and maintenance.

We often refer to Python as a ""simple, executable pseudo-code"" language. Such statements appear in books, tutorials and all over the Internet. But after junior developers join their first full-time job they are welcomed by protocols, decorators, context managers, metaclasses and rest of the ""real Python"" shenanigans. During my talk I will cover top-10 Python complexities and how they are required to fight the ""software complexity problem"" in big projects.

Track: PyCon: Django
Django is the most popular Python-based web framework used for creating web applications. The web applications are vulnerable for various reasons including a) configuration settings of the web applications b) lack of implementation of security best practices and secure coding and c) lack of awareness of secure first web applications among developers. The vulnerable web applications put the data of the customers at greater risk and the compromised code can lead to problems beyond control. It is very important to develop secure web applications to protect customer data and code to mitigate the risk. In this talk, we will focus on two aspects. First, performing penetration testing on Django web applications to identify vulnerabilities and scanning for Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) Top 10 risks. Second, strategies and configuration settings for making the source code and Django applications secure. We will also discuss the Djangohunter tool to identify incorrectly configured Django applications that are exposing sensitive information.
