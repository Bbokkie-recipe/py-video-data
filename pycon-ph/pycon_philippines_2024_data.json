        "description": "The State of Python in 2024\n\nIn this talk, Michael Kennedy gave a look at the current-day broader Python ecosystem. Explored questions such as: What are the important trends to keep an eye one? How have the traditionally popular frameworks such as Flask and Django adapted to some of the latest modern Python trends (e.g. async/await). What new frameworks and libraries are (about to) take the Python scene by storm? How is Python getting faster, dropping or sidestepping the GIL, and more? Why Python web frameworks are better choices than ever.\n\nAbout the Speaker:\nMichael Kennedy is the founder of Talk Python Training, host of the Talk Python To Me podcast, Python Software Foundation Fellow, and an entrepreneur.\n\n---\n\nWe invite you to join us in celebrating PyCon Philippines 2024 - where \"Gabay\" (guide) steers our collective journey of growth and relentless improvement.\n\n#gabay #pyconph2024 #pyconph #pythonph\n\nFor more details about PyCon Philippines 2024, please visit: https://pycon-2024.python.ph/",
