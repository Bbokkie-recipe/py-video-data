This data usually consists of a spatial component, of various attributes, and sometimes of a time reference (where, what, and when). \n\nEfficient processing and visualization of small to large-scale spatial data is a challenging task. \n\nThis talk describes how to process and visualize geospatial vector and raster data using Python and the Jupyter Notebook. There are numerous modules available which help using geospatial data in using low- and high-level interfaces. We will look at shapely, which is used for manipulation and analysis of geometric objects. Then we go further to Fiona – a module which handles geospatial vector data in a very pythonic way. We move on to raster data processing using the rasterio module and briefly look at the pyproj module which is used for transforming spatial reference systems. After that we look at GeoPandas which is basically an extended pandas module with support for geodata. At the end we will see how maps are created using the cartopy and folium modules. At the end of the talk some examples are shown how to use deep learning for raster analysis using a GPU cluster.",

        "description": "Would you like to see Big Data use-cases implemented on Spark? Are you working with Big Data projects already and you are considering introducing Spark to your technology stack? Would you like to know what Spark is good at and what parts of Spark are tricky? \n\nFirst I would like to provide an overview of multiple Spark use cases in various areas. The number of use cases described will be broad enough so it is likely that the audience will be able to find similarities to projects they are working on and see how they can use Spark to solve problems and bring value to the company. \n\nThe second part of the presentation will be focused on technical challenges which need to be solved when introducing Spark to your ecosystem. Spark has a nice and relatively intuitive API. It also promises high performance for crunching large datasets. It’s really easy to write an app in Spark. Unfortunately, the nice API might be misleading and make us forget that we are implementing a distributed application. For that reason it’s easy to write one which doesn’t perform the way you would expect or just fails for no obvious reason. I will show in a nutshell all the lessons I have learned over 3 years of experience with Spark. It will give you an overview of what to expect and help you to avoid making mistakes typically made by Spark newbies. We will emphasise what you should know about your data in order to write efficient Spark jobs and what the most important configuration tweaks and optimisation techniques are which will come in handy when implementing Spark-based solutions.",

        "description": "Presented at PyConLT 2019\n\nNASA plans to go back to the Moon in five years. And a first human may step on Mars in a couple of decades. But to get there, we need a well functioning crew who can work and live together in claustrophobic quarters for a very long time. Gender is an important variable that shapes crew interaction – on one hand mixed gender groups tend to perform better on various tasks, but on the other hand gender differences lead to additional stress, especially for women. \n\nIn a perfect world, researchers interested in people in space would study people in space. But in reality these data are very hard to get, and scientists conduct studies in space analogs instead. Space analogs are Earth-based facilities that resemble conditions of a space flight or space colony. \n\nMars Desert Research Station (MDRS) in Utah desert is one of them. It replicates a habitat on Mars that could be built using current technology, and it can accommodate a crew of six people at a time. MDRS crews rotate every 2-3 weeks, and more than 200 crews have participated in a simulation over the course of 17 field seasons. All crews are required to document their stay. \n\nIn this project I use simulated EVA (extravehicular activity) logs from all previous crews to investigate co-working patterns. I use Python's NLTK to process thousands of EVA logs to see who was working with whom on each simulated space walk. Then I use these data to construct co-working networks and to calculate who is the most central person in each crew (who worked with the most people on the most EVAs). Later, I use logit regression models to see whether men are more likely to be the most central accounting for their official role and other socio-demographic characteristics. \n\nMy preliminary results from 29 randomly selected and hand-coded crews show that men are 2.85 times more likely to be the most central in a crew than women, accounting for their official crew roles.",

        "description": "Histograms are a somewhat naive but also very powerful statistical tool for describing data. In many scientific Python libraries (and also your spreadsheet software), there are efficient methods for calculating and visualizing histograms but there is much more (fun as well as boring) stuff that can be done with them. The physt library focuses especially on those fun parts. What if you want to fill your histograms continuously (perhaps not even specifying a proper value range from the start)? What if you want to automatically find human-friendly bin edges (ever wondered why we should count people that are from 168.478 to 173.456 cm tall?)? What if you want to project or slice your multidimensional histograms? What if you wanted cylindrical or spherical histograms? What if you want to add the values of two histograms? What if you want to persist bins and meta-data alongside with the calculated values? The physt library takes histograms as proper objects and combines the computing power of numpy with visualization possibilities of matplotlib (and optionally other backends) and a level of semantics and more advanced functionality. In this talk, I will describe the object model behind the library and show some examples of how it can be used.",
