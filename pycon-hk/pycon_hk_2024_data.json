Explore cutting-edge techniques involved in areas such as model compilation, model compression, model inference batching, distributed training, and Large Model Inference (LMI) containers. Discover practical examples of optimizing some open-source models using techniques like LMI containers, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), Fully Sharded Data Parallelism (FSDP), Paged Attention, Rolling Batch, and more. \"The talk will delve into techniques and strategies for optimizing Large Language Models (LLMs) with Python. It focuses on addressing the computational challenges associated with training and deploying these models efficiently.\n\nOne key aspect discussed is model parallelism, which involves distributing the model across multiple devices or instances to overcome memory limitations. Tensor parallelism, a form of model parallelism, is explored, where individual tensors are split across devices. Pipeline parallelism, another technique, enables concurrent execution of different model components on separate devices.\n\nThe talk will also cover distributed training strategies, such as data parallelism and tensor-parallel language models, which leverage multiple devices to accelerate training. Techniques for reducing memory footprint, like quantization, pruning, and distillation, are explored as means to optimize LLM deployment.\n\nOptimizations for inference are also discussed, including model compression methods like quantization-aware training, pruning, and distillation. Kernel fusion, a technique that combines multiple operations into a single optimized kernel, is highlighted for improving inference performance. Additionally, the document explores accelerated inference using hardware accelerators.\n\nThe talk aims to provide guidance on leveraging Python's capabilities for efficient LLM training, deployment, and inference. It covers a range of strategies and techniques to address the computational challenges associated with these models, enabling researchers and practitioners to optimize LLMs for improved performance and cost-effectiveness.\n\nSpeaker: Haowen Huang\nHaowen Huang is currently a Senior Developer Advocate at Amazon Web Services (AWS).

Cryptographic signing of container images helps to verify the integrity of the image and makes sure it has not been tampered since its creation. Verification of the image signature also confirms that the expected software creator, whose identity was certified at the moment of signing, published the container image in their possession. \nIn this presentation, I will use an open source project “Sigstore”: a cryptographic signature tool that is for improving software supply chain security. The Sigstore framework empowers software developers and consumers to securely sign and verify software artifacts. Signatures are generated with ephemeral signing keys so there’s no need to manage keys. Signing events are recorded in a tamper-resistant public log so software developers can audit signing events.\n\nSpeaker: Frankie Ng\nFrankie Ng - Associate Principal Solution Architect\nFrankie Ng is an IT professional focusing on Open Source technology.

In Python 3.4, asyncio was introduced to allow non-blocking I/O, and concurrent.futures was introduced for an easier syntax to write parallel code. But still, Python is not super fast. In this talk, I will show case 10+ ways of generating data in parallel in Python and compare their performance. The unfortunate conclusion is that nothing is always the best, even with the free-threaded Python of 3.13, the silver bullet does not exist.\n\nThe talk is focus on CPython and experiment is done on Apple Silicon. It is to generate numpy array of random float as an example, and later to extend into Python lists of floats. I will compare the data generation throughput amongst using multiprocessing, threading, and concurrency.futures modules in Python as well as numba and joblib external libraries. The key result is to highlight the trade off between threading vs multiprocessing, in which if you want to use multiprocessing to work around the GIL, you pay the price of inter-process communication overhead. Even with free-threaded Python in 3.13 that you can avoid the GIL, you can't find a solution that is always better.\n\nSpeaker: Dr. Adrian Tam\nAdrian has been using Python for work for more than 20 years. Although not the only programming language to use, it is his favorite for quick experiments and prototyping. His interest is in mathematical modeling, number crunching, high performance computing, and in the last decade, machine learning and AI.\n\n#pyconhk #pyconhk2024",

With the growing popularity of large language models, Agents are what everyone is talking about. In simple terms, Agents can be defined as LLMs with the ability to self-reason and plan, just like humans. In my talk, I will focus on how to build an Autonomous Agentic workflow and the components required. Additionally, I will cover the concepts of planning and reasoning Agentic prompting such as REACT, LATS and so on to motivate the audience to stay updated with the Agentic world. \n\nProblem Statment:\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 have several limitations that hinder their full potential. They often struggle with maintaining contextual understanding over extended conversations, leading to disjointed or repetitive interactions. Additionally, LLMs can lack accuracy, fail to provide real-time information, self-reasoning to decompose while planning the task. This is where Agents comes. \n\nUnlike traditional LLMs, AI agents are designed to self-reason and plan, mimicking human cognitive processes. They can interact with their environment, make decisions, and take actions autonomously. This capability enables them to overcome some of the contextual and reasoning challenges that LLMs face, making them more suitable for complex, dynamic tasks. \n\nMy talk will cover:\n- How a simple execution of task is formed by humans?\n- Agentic Workflow and the major components required: This includes: Task, Memory, Tools, Agents, LLM and so on. \n- Planning and Reasoning: Under this I will cover Chain of thoughts, REACT, LATS prompt techniques, that is used to build Agentic workflow. \n- Conclusion\n\nSpeaker: Tarun Jain\nTarun Jain is a Data Scientist at [AI Planet](https://aiplanet.com), a Belgium based AI Startup.

The capabilities of local data stacks continue to grow with advancements in tools like Polars and DuckDB, the necessity of using Spark for end users is increasingly being questioned. \n\nTraditionally, Spark has been regarded as the most mature and reliable data processing framework, making it a default choice for many. However, the landscape has evolved significantly by 2024, with numerous libraries now offering more efficient and versatile local data processing solutions.\n\nThis presentation will explore these new alternatives, focusing on:\n\nSQLFrame: A framework providing a Spark DataFrame API that can interface with different computing engines.\nIbis: A unified API that seamlessly integrates dataframes and databases, eliminating the need to commit to a single engine.\nSQLGlot: A powerful tool for transpiling SQL queries between different dialects, enhancing compatibility and flexibility.\nOur goal is not to declare the obsolescence of Spark but to highlight efficient alternatives that may be better suited for specific environments and use cases. Attendees will gain insights into how these modern tools can be leveraged to optimize their local data processing workflows, potentially reducing the need for Spark in certain scenarios.\n\nSpeaker: Nok Lam Chan\nI am a recovering data scientist, currently working as a software engineer for an open source project called Kedro (https://github.com/kedro-org/kedro) in London.

And not just your app, but also ingress, the database, observability and the list goes on. We will go through your options for simplifying the operations of your web app using open source tooling. This will include using k8s directly, helm charts, IaaC using pulumi and new tooling developed by Canonical using juju. By the end of the talk you will have seen the benefits and drawbacks of each which will help you make an informed decision on which tool best suits your needs!\n\nSpeaker: YangSoo Yoon\nI am a platform developer at Canonical, working on a platform called Juju, a bootstrapped controller for both VMs and Kubernetes. I have always been an avid Python developer since his days in an AI startup to platform development.\nPlease don't hesitate to reach out to me if you have any questions!\n\n#pyconhk #pyconhk2024",
