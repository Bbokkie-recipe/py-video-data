This talk will cover various aspects of optimizing Large Language Models (LLMs) with Python, including quick start, availability optimization, and throughput optimization. Explore cutting-edge techniques involved in areas such as model compilation, model compression, model inference batching, distributed training, and Large Model Inference (LMI) containers. Discover practical examples of optimizing some open-source models using techniques like LMI containers, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), Fully Sharded Data Parallelism (FSDP), Paged Attention, Rolling Batch, and more. ""The talk will delve into techniques and strategies for optimizing Large Language Models (LLMs) with Python. It focuses on addressing the computational challenges associated with training and deploying these models efficiently.

One key aspect discussed is model parallelism, which involves distributing the model across multiple devices or instances to overcome memory limitations. Tensor parallelism, a form of model parallelism, is explored, where individual tensors are split across devices. Pipeline parallelism, another technique, enables concurrent execution of different model components on separate devices.

The talk will also cover distributed training strategies, such as data parallelism and tensor-parallel language models, which leverage multiple devices to accelerate training. Techniques for reducing memory footprint, like quantization, pruning, and distillation, are explored as means to optimize LLM deployment.

Optimizations for inference are also discussed, including model compression methods like quantization-aware training, pruning, and distillation. Kernel fusion, a technique that combines multiple operations into a single optimized kernel, is highlighted for improving inference performance. Additionally, the document explores accelerated inference using hardware accelerators.

The talk aims to provide guidance on leveraging Python's capabilities for efficient LLM training, deployment, and inference. It covers a range of strategies and techniques to address the computational challenges associated with these models, enabling researchers and practitioners to optimize LLMs for improved performance and cost-effectiveness.

Organizations are challenged in ensuring that the container image they are deploying is exactly what was produced in development and nothing has changed before it runs in production. Cryptographic signing of container images helps to verify the integrity of the image and makes sure it has not been tampered since its creation. Verification of the image signature also confirms that the expected software creator, whose identity was certified at the moment of signing, published the container image in their possession. 
In this presentation, I will use an open source project “Sigstore”: a cryptographic signature tool that is for improving software supply chain security. The Sigstore framework empowers software developers and consumers to securely sign and verify software artifacts. Signatures are generated with ephemeral signing keys so there’s no need to manage keys. Signing events are recorded in a tamper-resistant public log so software developers can audit signing events.

Python is infamous for its slowless and the GIL problem. In Python 3.4, asyncio was introduced to allow non-blocking I/O, and concurrent.futures was introduced for an easier syntax to write parallel code. But still, Python is not super fast. In this talk, I will show case 10+ ways of generating data in parallel in Python and compare their performance. The unfortunate conclusion is that nothing is always the best, even with the free-threaded Python of 3.13, the silver bullet does not exist.

The talk is focus on CPython and experiment is done on Apple Silicon. It is to generate numpy array of random float as an example, and later to extend into Python lists of floats. I will compare the data generation throughput amongst using multiprocessing, threading, and concurrency.futures modules in Python as well as numba and joblib external libraries. The key result is to highlight the trade off between threading vs multiprocessing, in which if you want to use multiprocessing to work around the GIL, you pay the price of inter-process communication overhead. Even with free-threaded Python in 3.13 that you can avoid the GIL, you can't find a solution that is always better.

Numba is a popular JIT compiler that translates Python code into optimized machine code for various hardware targets, and Numba-CUDA supports compilation of Python code for execution on NVIDIA devices. Whilst Numba-CUDA provides many basic accelerated programming function blocks out of the box, manually creating bindings for a CUDA device library is still laborious.

Numbast is an auto device binding generation tool created by NVIDIA. Numbast provides an end-to-end binding generation mechanism that quickly bridges the gap between the CUDA ecosystem and Python CUDA.

In this talk, attendees will learn about recent progress of accelerated computing in Python with Numba-CUDA, the internal mechanisms of Numbast, and get hands-on experience of crafting CUDA kernels in Numba-CUDA, as well as creating bindings with Numbast.

Additionally, we will provide an insight into how Numba is used across RAPIDS, Nvidia’s accelerated computing solution that focuses on making accelerated computing more accessible to the general python community. Time permitting, we will also introduce how user-defined functions (UDF) are used in cudf.pandas.

PySpark is widely adopted for data analysis in distributed computing environments. It supports not only the standard DataFrame API but also Python User Defined Functions (UDFs), Python Data Sources, Python UDTFs, and more. However, debugging and profiling applications in such distributed environments are often challenging - you can't simply add a breakpoint and inspect variables in your IDE.

In this presentation, I will demonstrate effective methods for debugging and profiling PySpark applications using existing tools. These include profiling tools that utilize cProfile, a standard Python profiler, along with various tricks and best practices for monitoring and debugging PySpark applications.

AI Agentic workflows will drive massive AI progress this year. This is what Professor Andrew Ng said about the rise of agents. With the growing popularity of large language models, Agents are what everyone is talking about. In simple terms, Agents can be defined as LLMs with the ability to self-reason and plan, just like humans. In my talk, I will focus on how to build an Autonomous Agentic workflow and the components required. Additionally, I will cover the concepts of planning and reasoning Agentic prompting such as REACT, LATS and so on to motivate the audience to stay updated with the Agentic world. 

Problem Statment:
Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 have several limitations that hinder their full potential. They often struggle with maintaining contextual understanding over extended conversations, leading to disjointed or repetitive interactions. Additionally, LLMs can lack accuracy, fail to provide real-time information, self-reasoning to decompose while planning the task. This is where Agents comes. 

Unlike traditional LLMs, AI agents are designed to self-reason and plan, mimicking human cognitive processes. They can interact with their environment, make decisions, and take actions autonomously. This capability enables them to overcome some of the contextual and reasoning challenges that LLMs face, making them more suitable for complex, dynamic tasks. 

My talk will cover:
- How a simple execution of task is formed by humans?
- Agentic Workflow and the major components required: This includes: Task, Memory, Tools, Agents, LLM and so on. 
- Planning and Reasoning: Under this I will cover Chain of thoughts, REACT, LATS prompt techniques, that is used to build Agentic workflow.

AI data is often stored in separate silos: databases, parquets/ORC files in cloud storage, and embeddings in vector databases, creating complexities in data management. 

To address the above issue, the Lance columnar format is specifically designed for multimodal AI. It has unique combination of capabilities including fast scan and point query, storing large blobs inline, and zero-cost schema evolutions, enabling the creation of a centralized, massive-scale, all-in-one data lake that can store all kinds of AI data—structured, unstructured, and embeddings—in one cohesive dataset.

Lance-Pytorch Dataset utilizes Lance’s embedded query engine. Written in Rust, it can quickly identify the most relevant and useful data for training without ever materializing such datasets using external systems. PyTorch training can leverage this unified data lake to seamlessly access and train from all data types, facilitating the creation of high-quality models.

This approach allows organizations to train or fine-tune foundation models that encompass comprehensive organizational knowledge, and significantly accelerates the training process while maintaining model quality.
