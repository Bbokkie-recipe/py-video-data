Django 3.1 reached an important milestone with synchronous and asynchronous views, and now the next big step is to take a long, hard look at the thing that makes up over half the Django codebase: the ORM.\r\n\r\nThe ORM is gigantic, old, and complex - and has an API designed and tweaked over many years. We'll look at some of those design decisions and how they reflect in the world of async, the challenges that underlie a hybrid API, as well as how the safety-first nature of the ORM has to evolve to deal with new and exciting async ways of breaking things.\r\n\r\nWe'll also dive into what it means to have asynchronous database backends, and how support for those are progressing in the Python world - and how we're trying to ship something that's useful before fully asynchronous database APIs are done.\n\nProduced by NDV: https://youtube.com/channel/UCQ7dFBzZGlBvtU2hCecsBBg?sub_confirmation=1\n\nPython, PyCon, PyConAU, PyConline\n\nFri Sep  4 17:10:00 2020 at Python 2",

        "description": "Lorenzo Peña\n\nhttps://2020.pycon.org.au/program/CRSJXF\n\nAlthough rough for the world, 2020 is proving a good year (and decade start) for Django. Boring batteries-included frameworks and established monolith makers are shining again, in a world where the hype-enchantment of JavaScript and micro-everything is starting to wear off and fall into a more mature position of tradeoffs. After 15 years of life, Django continues to prove solid, battle tested, and very capable of major undertakings in the web arena.\r\n\r\nOver the last decade, the competence of the framework has extended to the SaaS world, through a number of packages that have emerged as viable options for making Django multi-tenant. PostgreSQL concept of _schemas_ has opened a new exploration space for multi-tenancy, by combining the power of RDBMS native isolation with the reduced costs of managing a single database.\r\n\r\nHowever, nothing comes for free. The ease of using PostgreSQL schemas for multi-tenancy in Django comes at the expense of some challenges that must be overcome in the short, medium, and long term, if the project seeks to survive while gracefully escaling to success.\r\n\r\nIn this talk we will cover the major challenges of doing multi-tenancy in Django through PostgreSQL schemas. You will learn the pros and cons of the approach as you move from tutorial-grade projects to massive multi-tenant behemoths. By the end, you will be able to answer whether or not this is going to be a feasible approach for your next multi-million dollar idea.\n\nProduced by NDV: https://youtube.com/channel/UCQ7dFBzZGlBvtU2hCecsBBg?sub_confirmation=1\n\nPython, PyCon, PyConAU, PyConline\n\nFri Sep  4 17:45:00 2020 at Python 2",

        "description": "Simon Willison\n\nhttps://2020.pycon.org.au/program/73UK8X\n\nMany data enthusiasts dream of analyzing their own personal data, but few find time to build their own pipeline for it. This talk will show you how to get started with personal analytics with the highest possible return on your invested effort.\r\n\r\nSQLite is the ideal tool for building a personal data analysis pipeline: it's free, fast and widely supported. Each database is a single file on disk, so you don't need to set up a database server to start using it. Tools that import data into SQLite can be written in any programming language, and its JSON support means it can even ingest data that may not fit neatly in a standard relational database table.\r\n\r\nDatasette is a Python application that provides an interface over SQLite. It lets you bookmark and queries in your browser and export the results as JSON and CSV. The Datasette plugin ecosystem has over 30 plugins that extend Datasette in different ways, adding visualization tools, alternative export formats and more.\r\n\r\nI'll show how to combine SQLite, Datasette and some simple Python scripts to ingest personal data from multiple different sources and build a personal data warehouse for your digital life. Data sources will include:\r\n\r\n- Twitter\r\n- Facebook\r\n- Apple Photos\r\n- LinkedIn\r\n- Google (via Google Takeout)\r\n- Foursquare / Swarm\r\n- GitHub\r\n- Apple Health\r\n- 23AndMe\r\n\r\nTechniques that work for an individual can work for organizations too. I'll finish by showing how this approach to working with data can scale up to solving professional problems in addition to personal analytics.\n\nProduced by NDV: https://youtube.com/channel/UCQ7dFBzZGlBvtU2hCecsBBg?sub_confirmation=1\n\nPython, PyCon, PyConAU, PyConline\n\nFri Sep  4 16:00:00 2020 at Curlyboi",

        "description": "Thomas Woolford\n\nhttps://2020.pycon.org.au/program/USWEYZ\n\nScientists, Researchers and Software Engineering projects should be paying attention to the reproducibility of their results. The best way to guarantee that the project you build today will be the same when built next week is to exactly specify your dependency tree. \r\n\r\nImperative package management approaches (such as apt/pip/conda) provide few assurances that the package version you get today is the same version you'll get tomorrow, or that installing packages in a different order won't change the versions resolved. The problem gets even harder when you want to integrate with native extensions that rely on platform libraries and the ephemeral contents of /usr/share/. \r\n\r\nIn this talk I'll discuss how Nix package manager can provide a complete dependency management solution for python projects on Linux and Mac. Nix can install and track exact, reproducible versions of python packages and their transitive dependencies including platform libraries, down to the compiler version that created them. No more guessing why your teammate can trigger a bug that you can't reproduce.\r\n\r\nNix can use this dependency info to quickly get new teammates up and running with a full development environment, no worries about the setup instructions being out of date or incompatible with their chosen OS flavor. Finally, Nix can build your project in a sealed build environment that prevents your project sneakily including files that haven't been declared as dependencies. You can then confidently deploy these builds as minimal docker images, VM images, or directly via nix package caches.\n\nProduced by NDV: https://youtube.com/channel/UCQ7dFBzZGlBvtU2hCecsBBg?sub_confirmation=1\n\nPython, PyCon, PyConAU, PyConline\n\nFri Sep  4 13:20:00 2020 at Obvious",

        "description": "Cheng-Lin Yang\n\nhttps://2020.pycon.org.au/program/Y3SXGF\n\nIf you've been a data scientist or researcher long enough, you must have encountered a situation where your NumPy code ran quickly on small datasets in a testing environment but performed poorly on real-world datasets (100x larger or more). In this talk, I will introduce three Pythonic solutions to improve NumPy performance drastically without modifying too many codes.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the talk, a math equation: logsumexp, which is widely used in machine learning, will be illustrated. I will show how it is implemented with pure NumPy and use it as a benchmark so we can compare it to three proposed solutions at the end of the talk.\r\n\r\nThen, three solutions: CuPy, Numba, and Pythran will be presented in separate sections. In each section, I will give a brief introduction to the solution and show how to apply this solution to our benchmark code.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the talk, I will compare these solutions from different aspects:\r\n\r\n    * How much performance is boosted after each solution is applied\r\n    * Ease to apply on your existing code (including the ease of debugging)\r\n    * Limitations of each solution\r\n    * Which solution should be applied first in given scenarios\r\n\r\nLast but not the least, I will show a relatively new but interesting solution: Transonic to the audience so they can give it a try on their side project.\n\nProduced by NDV: https://youtube.com/channel/UCQ7dFBzZGlBvtU2hCecsBBg?sub_confirmation=1\n\nPython, PyCon, PyConAU, PyConline\n\nSat Sep  5 16:00:00 2020 at Obvious",

It is gaining popularity among data scientists and analysts around the world as it helps them make a data dashboard that is elegant and aesthetically pleasing. In my presentation, I’ll briefly state what is Streamlit and how it is super useful for data scientists and analysts. I’ll then go over the basic Streamlit components and examples that demonstrate how easy it is to make an interactive data dashboard in Python. (Yes you heard it right, no JavaScript required :D) By the end of this talk, you’ll know the basics of Streamlit and would be able to build an interactive web application for data visualization and analysis with just a few lines of code in Python.\n\nProduced by NDV: https://youtube.com/channel/UCQ7dFBzZGlBvtU2hCecsBBg?sub_confirmation=1\n\nPython, PyCon, PyConAU, PyConline\n\nFri Sep  4 11:00:00 2020 at Curlyboi",

Graph DBMS technology has been coming along for the last decade-or-so and is now quite mature. Everyone wants one, just ask a Fortune 500 company. \r\n\r\nI mean: why have a table when you can have a knowledge graph? Why not be able to whip up a recommendations engine (or indeed a fraud detector) in a few minutes?\r\n\r\nGraph databases store data in Graphs -- that is NOT chart-visualisation nor syntax standard on API layers (NOT a GraphQL talk), but per the paper written by the mathematician Euler in 1736: those data structures which are \"nodes\" connected by \"relationships\".\r\n\r\nThis talk will be a primer on what this all means, how they work and when they're a good idea to use. There will also be a demonstration and discussion about how to kick off with graph DBs driven by python, specifically for people who are familiar with conventional databases, but have never used Graph databases before, but might be curious.\n\nSee code sample: https://github.com/elena/graph-fun\n\nProduced by NDV: https://youtube.com/channel/UCQ7dFBzZGlBvtU2hCecsBBg?sub_confirmation=1\n\nPython, PyCon, PyConAU, PyConline\n\nSat Sep  5 14:05:00 2020 at Python 2",

        "description": "Genevieve Buckley\n\nhttps://2020.pycon.org.au/program/KHULAN\n\nImage datasets are large, and becoming larger. The widely used benchmark dataset COCO (Common Objects in Context) contains 330,000 individual images. The average size of a single entry on the image database EMPIAR is over 1TB, and can easily reach several terabytes.  Even where individual images are small enough to fit in-memory, many existing parallelization methods are difficult to scale seamlessly between a laptop and a supercomputing cluster. For instance, the python multiprocessing module is restricted to a single mode and can't take advantage of multiple compute nodes on a distributed supercomputing cluster.\r\n\r\nWe need easy ways to work with large image data. This talk introduces dask-image, a python library for distributed image processing. The target audience are python programmers currently using numpy and scipy with large array data, where the whole dataset cannot fit in memory or is close to that limit. It's for people who want to get started with parallel processing, either because they have large single-image data, or because they want to do batch processing applying the same analysis to many smaller images (sometimes known an embarrassingly parallel problem). The specific image analysis functions provided by dask-image are of broad interest to a diverse range of analysis applications including (but not limited to) video/streaming data, computer vision, and scientific fields including astronomy, microscopy and geosciences.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, this talk will cover:\r\n* An overview of the dask-image library\r\n    * Lazy image loading\r\n    * Image pre-processing functionality (convolutions, filters, etc.)\r\n    * Analysis of segmented images (distributed labeling, and measurements of those label regions)\r\n* Mixing in your own custom analysis functions (using dask delayed, map_blocks, and map_overlap)\r\n* A practical case study of a Python image processing pipeline\r\n\r\ndask-image is open source, released under a BSD 3-Clause license, and can be installed using conda or pip. You can find the source code at https://github.com/dask/dask-image and the quickstart guide at https://github.com/dask/dask-examples/blob/master/applications/image-processing.ipynb\n\nProduced by NDV: https://youtube.com/channel/UCQ7dFBzZGlBvtU2hCecsBBg?sub_confirmation=1\n\nPython, PyCon, PyConAU, PyConline\n\nFri Sep  4 13:55:00 2020 at Curlyboi",

        "description": "Dipam Paul, Alankrita Tewari\n\nhttps://2020.pycon.org.au/program/DUGUZZ\n\nAlmost every individual today in the field of Data Science would know about the concept of Ensemble Learning in ML (ideally, the last chapter we read in the Machine Learning pedagogy). However, it is to also note that very few literatures exists to ensemble Deep Neural Architectures. Therefore, this is where we step forward and propose an approach to solve (almost) any medical imaging problem with the means of our Ensemble approach. Our approach does not just \"solve\" medical imaging problems but help practitioners to build unique and seamless architectures that almost never goes wrong (at least, not on your good days).\r\n\r\nWhy use an Ensemble at all?\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this section, I will try to anticipate the common notions one would have while reading this proposal and try to address the same in advance.\r\n\r\nOf course, there are brilliant pre-trained architectures available and building up a custom CNN architecture takes seconds today, right? Then, why take the extra headache of combining architectures after all?\r\n\r\nI wanted to give you a solid reason why then I thought I'll give you three:\r\n\r\n(1) Attaining state-of-the-art accuracy:\r\n\r\nTo elucidate on this, let's recall a very famous (or, infamous) chapter from our old books on Elementary Statistics that is - Central Limit Theorem. This theorem gives us two very important implications:\r\n\r\nThere are two big implications of the Central Limit theorem:\r\n\r\nEnsembles of many random processes/variables converge to Gaussian distributions. That’s why normal distributions are everywhere.\r\nWhen adding together random numbers, the variance of the sum is the sum of the variances of those numbers.\r\nWhich, in the essence of Machine/Deep Learning, translates to the fact that when we combine n (number of) architectures together then the combined architecture let's say, x will at all times produce better performance or results on standard metrics that every individual model in the n-cluster of models.\r\n\r\nA slight limitation:\r\n\r\nCentral Limit Theorem also states that no matter how many models one tries to Ensemble one can never reach the accuracy of 1 (or, 100).\r\n\r\nBut that's alright, I believe. We don't need to attain a full 100% accuracy to prove the reliability of a model, do we?\r\n\r\nFurthermore, we have proven this hypothesis of ours of attaining state-of-the-art accuracy in our published works with regards to the same. Kindly, refer.\r\n\r\n(2) Model Diversity: \r\n\r\nThis is arguably the most important contribution of ours out of all three which gives an indication of the reliability of our approach. Our experiments (which are also included in our papers) also goes on to show how well the architecture performs on external unseen examples - images which are not even part of the dataset.\r\n\r\nWhy is this important?\r\n\r\nElementary. We are dealing with Medical data where there is a plethora of possibilities, complications and unique cases. Hence, we can NEVER be too sure. Therefore, this was one of the most instrumental steps we had to set in motion in order to know if it's actually working or not.\r\n\r\nFuture tangible implementation scope: Mobile App or Web App to be used in Clinics and Hospitals.\r\n\r\n(3) Tackling the problem of Model Over-fitting:\r\n\r\nIn this contribution, we try to mitigate the problem of over-fitting to the greatest extent possible WITHOUT employing techniques such as Cross-Validation. The reason behind taking the entire dataset at once is very simple: Let's say you are dealing with a Binary-Class data with a huge class imbalance problem. Cross-Validation will not let you manually select the number of images that goes into each split that you make from each individual classes. It is also important to mention that the randomisation process ain't so bad altogether however, there's always room for improvements and alternate doors can also lead to better destinations.\n\nProduced by NDV: https://youtube.com/channel/UCQ7dFBzZGlBvtU2hCecsBBg?sub_confirmation=1\n\nPython, PyCon, PyConAU, PyConline\n\nSat Sep  5 13:00:00 2020 at Obvious",

We will then discuss the concepts of **abstraction** and **application** in lambda calculus and then move on to understand what a **substitution** is and how can these be implemented in Python. We will finally study some combinators which are the basic building blocks of combinatory logic, before ending with encoding datatypes in lambda calculus and implementing the same with Python lambda. Datatypes we will be discussing are:\r\n\r\n1. Boolean values like TRUE and FALSE\r\n2. Logical operators like AND, OR and NOT\r\n3. Church Numerals\r\n4. Predicates\r\n5. Recursions\n\nProduced by NDV: https://youtube.com/channel/UCQ7dFBzZGlBvtU2hCecsBBg?sub_confirmation=1\n\nPython, PyCon, PyConAU, PyConline\n\nSat Sep  5 14:40:00 2020 at Python 2",

Its value is in generating large quantities of similar but not identical assets such as textures and models. This talk will cover the topic of using procedural generation to create a landscape, which will give an illustration of the strengths of procedural generation and ways to overcome its weaknesses.\r\n\r\nMore specifically, the topics covered are:\r\n- using layered opensimplex noise to create a heightmap, as well as an overview of types of noise and the shortcomings of purely noise-based terrain\r\n- using image processing techniques to add mountain ranges in a manner more consistent with real-world geography than noise alone would allow\r\n- further enhancing the terrain by converting it from a heightmap to voxels, and then applying an erosion simulation\n\nProduced by NDV: https://youtube.com/channel/UCQ7dFBzZGlBvtU2hCecsBBg?sub_confirmation=1\n\nPython, PyCon, PyConAU, PyConline\n\nSat Sep  5 13:35:00 2020 at Floperator",

One of my inspirations for this talk is the realisation that in some ways we have lost our way with testing, losing sight of some of the very early wisdom.\r\n\r\nI will talk about some of those conversations we have, the language we use, but I will also present some advice, with concrete examples, of how we all might improve how we approach and implement testing.\n\nProduced by NDV: https://youtube.com/channel/UCQ7dFBzZGlBvtU2hCecsBBg?sub_confirmation=1\n\nPython, PyCon, PyConAU, PyConline\n\nSat Sep  5 13:00:00 2020 at Python 2",

Computers can execute all our \r\npre-defined tests very quickly - and this is definitely a good thing, especially for \r\nregression tests - but the tricky parts are still done by humans.\r\n\r\nWe select test cases (inputs) and check that the corresponding outputs make sense;\r\nwe write functions that \"arrange, act, and assert\" for our tests; and we decide -\r\nor script via CI systems - which tests to execute and when.\r\n\r\nSo lets explore some next-generation tools that we could use to automate these \r\nremaining parts of a testing workflow!\r\n\r\nPROPERTY-BASED TESTING helps you to write more powerful tests by automating selection \r\nof test cases: instead of listing input-output pairs, you describe the kind of data \r\nyou want and write a test that passes *for all X...*.  We'll see a live demo, and \r\nlearn something about the Python builtins in the process!\r\n\r\nCODE INTROSPECTION, and a handy templating tool, can help write tests for you.\r\nDo you need to know any more than which code to test, and what properties should hold?\r\n\r\nADAPTIVE FUZZING tools take CI to its logical conclusion: instead of running a fixed\r\nset of tests on each push, they sit on a server and run tests full-time... fine-tuning\r\nthemselves to find bugs in *your* project and pulling each new commit as it lands!\r\n\r\nBy the end of this talk, you'll know what these three kinds of tools can do - \r\nand how to get started with automating the *rest* of your testing tomorrow.\n\nProduced by NDV: https://youtube.com/channel/UCQ7dFBzZGlBvtU2hCecsBBg?sub_confirmation=1\n\nPython, PyCon, PyConAU, PyConline\n\nSat Sep  5 11:35:00 2020 at Curlyboi",

Building out experimental services on our personal AWS accounts because we couldn't get the permissions we needed on the company's systems.\r\n\r\nEvery organisation's infrastructure has its shadow, the unofficial system of servers, accounts, and hardware that crisscrosses and bypasses the sanctioned pathways. It is every security department's nightmare and every development team's open secret. From the newest graduate to the CEO, we all know at least some of these shortcuts.\r\n\r\nThis talk is a space for both confession and redemption: in it, we will delve into the psychology that leads to the development of shadow IT, the opportunities that can grow out of this corporate underground, and how to get these systems out of the shadows and into the light.

In 2019 we closed our doors, to reshape our Federation Square building in order to become more public-facing, and to house a major new permanent exhibition, The Story of the Moving Image. \r\n\r\nAs you might imagine, we have a *lot* of moving image to show, and a lot of fascinating objects to tell people about, all of which can be overwhelming to some audiences. That's why we designed and built a system called The Lens. Every visitor to the museum can pick up a Lens, which they use to collect objects and media to watch and explore in their own time. The Lens depends on a network of hundreds of Raspberry Pi devices to display media and interact with visitors, all running Opensourced Python code. All these devices need to be robust and maintainable in order to survive the 10-year lifespan of the exhibition.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we'll give you a tour of the technology at ACMI, including our Internet-of-Things fleet and management tools, and XOS, the eXperience Operating System, which provides content and configuration to the devices.\n\nProduced by NDV: https://youtube.com/channel/UCQ7dFBzZGlBvtU2hCecsBBg?sub_confirmation=1\n\nPython, PyCon, PyConAU, PyConline\n\nSat Sep  5 16:35:00 2020 at Curlyboi",

Have you ever wished you could automate some of the boring stuff while adding extra robustness to your workflows so that you and your team can have greater confidence and work more efficiently?\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I will present the concept of MLOps (kind of DevOps for ML scenarios, also referred to as DataOps or AIOps) and how adopting these practices can improve your team's workflows. You will learn how to automate some tasks within the ML lifecycle: from data transformation to model training, testing and validation, and deployment — making your workflows not only more seamless but your entire work more reproducible, reliable, and robust.\r\nYou do not need to be a DevOps engineer to benefit from these practices, but you can indeed leverage existing open-source tools and platforms to improve your Data Science workflows.\r\nFor completeness, I'll show a live end to end example, integrating MLOps practices for Machine Learning - from data processing to model training, validation and deployment. I will highlight the essential tips and tricks for each of the involved stages. You will leave the talk with practical recommendations and examples to get you started on adopting MLOps practices.\n\nProduced by NDV: https://youtube.com/channel/UCQ7dFBzZGlBvtU2hCecsBBg?sub_confirmation=1\n\nPython, PyCon, PyConAU, PyConline\n\nFri Sep  4 16:35:00 2020 at Curlyboi",

        "description": "Shivashis Padhi\n\nhttps://2020.pycon.org.au/program/Q7GJNZ\n\n### Introduction\r\n\r\nEvery Python script involves import statements. And if you develop software with Python, you might already have come across import and path related errors like ImportError, ModuleNotFoundError, etc.\r\n\r\nIt's important to know the import mechanics, both for general knowledge, and to develop custom plugins to tweak the import system. In this talk, we'd discuss in detail about how the import system works, its components and what tasks they perform respectively.\r\n\r\n### Who should attend this talk?\r\nThis talk is most suitable for beginner to intermediate level Pythonistas.\r\n\r\n### How does the talk proceed?\r\n - The talk starts with packages in Python, and how to organize Python files in order to make them distributable, and importable.\r\n - It proceeds to discuss about $PATH and $PYTHONPATH, and how they are used to enable system-wide imports, and how capable are Python's path based import handlers, if they let a programmer import from remote URIs, etc.\r\n - Different types of packages such as regular packages, namespace packages, frozen modules, etc. are discussed.\r\n - After that, some key components are introduced i.e sys.modules and how modules are refreshed and regulated in runtime, what finders and loaders are, and what 'import protocol' is, sys.meta_path, sys.path_hooks.\r\n\r\n- The talk then goes in detail about finders, the default finders in Python, spec object, and its functioning.\r\nAfter finders, loaders are discussed with sample code, explaining the steps involved from processing a spec, and creating, executing, and loading a module to sys.modules.\r\n- After finders and loaders, 'import hooks' are discussed i.e how Python allows injection of custom components to handle a pre-defined import statement.\r\n- This follows a demonstration of import hooks, implementation of a meta_path finder Class which protects importing of modules from an http server with a token exchange. (So the source code is protected, and it can be logged who requested the source code by a signature to act against misuse.)\r\n- The demonstration is followed by listing some important use cases of import hooks, and how folks have used it in the past.\r\n\r\n### What can someone get out of this talk?\r\n\r\nAn understanding of the import system's mechanics, which helps to quickly debug and fix path/import related errors.\r\nKnowledge of import hooks, to build custom import related plugins.\r\n\r\n### Outline\r\n\r\nTime Duration - Topic\r\n\r\n0 - 4 Introduction to packages and how to organize packages\r\n\r\n4 - 7 Types of packages in python, and the default ones the import system supports.\r\n\r\n7 - 12 Components of import system - sys.modules - finders and loaders - chronology of import related tasks\r\n\r\n12 - 15 Finders, examples of finders, and how they function, find_spec function\r\n\r\n15 - 17 sys.meta_path, sys.path_hooks in detail\r\n\r\n17 - 19 Introduction to PEP 302, and import hooks\r\n\r\n19 - 22 explain loaders with template code\r\n\r\n23 - 25 code walkthrough and demonstration of an implementation of import hooks\r\n\r\n25 - 26 briefly cover 'importing of submodules' topic with an example\r\n\r\n26 - 28 present use-cases of import hooks, and usage in industry, conclude.\r\n\r\n28 - 30 Q&A\r\n\r\n### Prerequisites:\r\n\r\n - Syntactic knowledge of Python\r\n - Should have come across import/$PYTHONPATH related errors\r\n\r\nIf you don't know either and still like the talk idea, please follow [this gist](https://gist.github.com/plant99/9fee5dbe73f25d4da9c7fb956a36b889) to 'intentionally' come across the errors :)\r\n\r\n## Content URLs\r\n\r\n[WIP slides](https://speakerdeck.com/plant99/wip-what-happens-behind-execution-of-an-import-statement)\r\n\r\n[Longer description of the talk idea as blogpost](https://plant99.bitbucket.io/pages/blogs/ten.html)\n\nProduced by NDV: https://youtube.com/channel/UCQ7dFBzZGlBvtU2hCecsBBg?sub_confirmation=1\n\nPython, PyCon, PyConAU, PyConline\n\nSat Sep  5 11:00:00 2020 at Curlyboi",

Gatsby (https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) is a open source framework based on React. Wagtail (https://wagtail.io/) is a Django CMS with LOTS of cool features for content creators, and \"plays nicely with everything else in your tech stack\" (source: Wagtail) because its built on and easily integrates with all uses of Python. \r\n\r\n\r\nWhy? Not only do I enjoy the new and shiny things as a consultant, both Wagtail and GatsbyJS are established frameworks and active communities that put considerable effort in providing a great product with a smooth developer experience. We enjoy the benefits of Django / Wagtail CMS, with a incredibly fast pre-fetched progressive web app with GatsbyJS. The goal is nice, fast and fun. \r\n\r\n\r\nI am approaching this talk by walking through how I started out with minimal experience with GatsbyJS or GraphQL, and moderate experience with React and headless Wagtail to creating and deploying (Netlify) this app. I am not an expert in either technology, but was able to quickly navigate getting started as well as identify lots of resources in both communities to build out in a more complex experience.\n\nProduced by NDV: https://youtube.com/channel/UCQ7dFBzZGlBvtU2hCecsBBg?sub_confirmation=1\n\nPython, PyCon, PyConAU, PyConline\n\nSat Sep  5 10:25:00 2020 at Floperator",

        "description": "Christopher Neugebauer\n\nhttps://2020.pycon.org.au/program/VVNEZR\n\nWhen you type “import this” into a Python interpreter, you get PEP-20, 20* aphorisms that describe what “Good” Python code looks like. Most of these are prescriptive, and have been used to settle countless arguments about how Python should grow, or how new ideas should be implemented.\r\n\r\nBut in these 20 aphorisms (which you may know as the “Zen of Python”), there are some inherent contradictions. \r\n\r\nWhen “explicit is better than implicit” and “simple is better than complex”, what does it mean when being explicit means you must introduce complexity? \r\n\r\nWhen “readability counts” and “special cases aren’t special enough to break the rules”, what does it mean when making code more readable presents a special case in your codebase?\r\n\r\nThe answer lies in one often-forgotten aphorism: “practicality beats purity”. When you can weigh practicality as a factor, you can decide that other factors are restrictive, and discard them as “impractical”. This idea shows up in many places in Python:\r\n\r\nType hints can help you to be explicit, but they introduce complexity. Focusing on practicality means you can adopt type hints only when you need them. Decorators are simple, but can be used to introduce ambiguity. In many cases, the practical benefits of decorators outweigh their potential for misuse.\r\n\r\nBut how far can the pursuit of practicality let you go? Does practicality let you treat the other 19 aphorisms as optional? Does practicality give you an escape hatch from the rest of the Zen of Python? \r\n\r\nIn this talk, we’ll look at how practicality has been a guiding principle in the evolution of Python. We’ll look at how to weigh practicality in the face of the other 19 aphorisms of PEP-20, and we’ll look at how focusing on practicality can guide you towards these other attributes of good Python.\r\n\r\n--- \r\n(* per PEP-20, the Zen of Python contains “20 aphorisms, only 19 of which have been written down.”)\n\nProduced by NDV: https://youtube.com/channel/UCQ7dFBzZGlBvtU2hCecsBBg?sub_confirmation=1\n\nPython, PyCon, PyConAU, PyConline\n\nSat Sep  5 10:25:00 2020 at Curlyboi",

        "description": "Cheuk Ting Ho\n\nhttps://2020.pycon.org.au/program/VLPJZL\n\nAt the start, we will be using `dir` to look into the secret functions Python objects have. Eg:\r\n`__getitem__`, `__iter__` and `__next__` Then, we will investigate where is the dunder function goes? Why is it not accessible. And at the end, we will see how dunder functions can change the identity of the Python objects.\r\n\r\nThis talk is for attendees who have just begin their Python journey. By explaining the dunder functions and the nature of Python objects, attendees will have a better understanding of why Python is fundamentally different from other programming languages. Hopefully, this knowledge will help them out when they continue their Python journeys.\n\nProduced by NDV: https://youtube.com/channel/UCQ7dFBzZGlBvtU2hCecsBBg?sub_confirmation=1\n\nPython, PyCon, PyConAU, PyConline\n\nSat Sep  5 13:35:00 2020 at Obvious",

        "description": "Julin S\n\nhttps://2020.pycon.org.au/program/HWU9J7\n\n#### Why\r\nMost of the well established projects follow some practices and has some mechanism in place to ensure better maintainability.\r\n\r\nBut we can find a good number of packages online which are being developed without an equivalent mechanism.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I will mention some tools, which when used, can lay the foundation for a well formed package.\r\n\r\n#### Well-formed package\r\n\r\nA package whose source has some structure which makes testing and development more efficient and less error-prone.\r\n\r\nSuch a package also makes working with its source a more pleasant experience.\r\n\r\nA well-formed package makes things easier for both the developer and the user.\r\n\r\nBut it is easier to get started with a structure than to maintain that form. Which calls for a mechanism to maintain that structure.\r\n\r\n#### How\r\n\r\nThe source code should adopt a style and stick with it. A linting tool like pylint can help with it.\r\nOr you could use black.\r\n\r\nUse type annotations along with tools like mypy.\r\n\r\nEliminate unused code with `vulture`.\r\n\r\nAdd tests to be sure that the different functionalities work as intended using tools like pytest or the built-in unittest.\r\nThis will be extremely useful to be sure that further modifications do not break existing code.\r\n\r\nEnsure proper test coverage with coverage.py\r\nAfter all, adding tests isn't everything. One got to make sure it reaches every nook and corner.\r\n\r\nAutomate tests with tox, nox, etc.\r\n\r\nPackage the project in tune with the future of packaging.\r\nsetuptools, flit or poetry\r\n\r\nAnd add some CI/CD.\r\n\r\nOther tools like pre-commit, bumpversion, etc may also be used.\r\n\r\n#### Intended audience\r\n\r\nPeople who create and publish python packages.\r\nThe presentation is from the package developer's perspective and not exactly about the innards of the different python packaging tools.\r\n\r\n#### Pre-requisites\r\n\r\nBasic Python programming.\r\nGit\r\n\r\n## Tentative talk outline\r\n\r\n - Linting\r\n - Type checking\r\n - Eliminating dead code\r\n - Tests\r\n - Test coverage\r\n - Test automation\r\n - Packaging\r\n - CI/CD\r\n - Other tools\r\n - Future of packaging\r\n\r\n#### Speaker info (anonymized):\r\n\r\nUsing Python for 5 years. Interested in text processing.\r\n\r\nPublished a few packages to PyPI using different packaging tools.\r\n\r\nThe proposed talk is derived from experience of creating them.\n\nProduced by NDV: https://youtube.com/channel/UCQ7dFBzZGlBvtU2hCecsBBg?sub_confirmation=1\n\nPython, PyCon, PyConAU, PyConline\n\nSat Sep  5 13:00:00 2020 at Floperator",

        "description": "Kathy Reid\n\nhttps://2020.pycon.org.au/program/99XMUR\n\nBy 2025, there will be over 8 million voice assistants in the world. They are found on your mobile phone, in your home, in your car, and over time, will be embedded in many cyber-physical systems across the world. At the same time, there are over 7000 languages spoken in the world - \"living languages\".\r\n\r\nBut voice assistants support just a fraction of these languages. Moreover, accents and diversity _within_ a spoken language are not well handled by voice assistants. For example, African American voices are much less likely to be correctly recognised by the speech recognition algorithms used within voice assistants. And as we start to interact with systems using voice, we have a human desire to listen to voices we resonate with. Voices like us. For many people, there are no synthesised voices that reflect their heritage, language, and gender expression.\r\n\r\nThere are several techno-social reasons behind this state of affairs.\r\n\r\n* The intent of a commercial voice assistant is to make money. This drives technical development in certain ways, such as certain languages being seen as more lucrative than others, irrespective of the number of speakers of that language. For example, there is more voice assistant support for Icelandic, a language spoken by 314,000 people, than there is for Kiswahili, a language spoken by over 100,000,000 people in Eastern Africa. Why? Money. \r\n\r\n* The big tech companies behind voice assistants have typically poor gender and racial diversity in their talent pool. Diversity in developers leads to diversity in development.\r\n\r\n* The data used for training speech recognition and speech synthesis models often has racial and gender biases. These can stem from both selection bias, but also broader systemic issues of inequality, such as the use of voice assistant technology to gather data - and the affordability of both that technology and its pre-requisites, such as internet access.\r\n\r\n* Many languages are considered \"low resource languages\". This means they often don't have written transcriptions, which are needed to train machine learning models. Those creating transcriptions often face the \"transcription bottleneck\" - a workflow impediment that means the creation of resources consumes significant labour time.\r\n\r\nThere are many established and emerging open source tools - many in Python - and movements that _individually_ are addressing aspects of this broader techno-social system. **Together**, they can effect change so that _everyone, everywhere can be afforded the benefits of voice technology_.\n\nProduced by NDV: https://youtube.com/channel/UCQ7dFBzZGlBvtU2hCecsBBg?sub_confirmation=1\n\nPython, PyCon, PyConAU, PyConline\n\nSat Sep  5 14:05:00 2020 at Floperator",

Quadruple the RAM of the database instance! Beef up your Elasticache!\r\n\r\nOkay, but what if you can't just throw your employers' money at it? What if, to keep your side project affordable, you bought a reserved instance for it just a week before it started to go viral? What if the number of users starts going up 50% per week and... doesn't... stop...\r\n\r\nYou're gonna have to get clever.\n\nProduced by NDV: https://youtube.com/channel/UCQ7dFBzZGlBvtU2hCecsBBg?sub_confirmation=1\n\nPython, PyCon, PyConAU, PyConline\n\nFri Sep  4 14:30:00 2020 at Obvious",

        "description": "Florian Haas\n\nhttps://2020.pycon.org.au/program/YZYTMX\n\nWhen you’re running a Django application, the following things are all pretty commonplace:\r\n\r\n* You use MySQL or MariaDB as your Django database backend.\r\n* You don’t run a single standalone MySQL/MariaDB instance, but a Galera cluster.\r\n* You run asynchronous tasks in Celery.\r\n\r\nNow suppose your application doesn’t talk to your Galera cluster directly, but via HAProxy. That’s not exactly unheard of; in fact it’s an officially documented HA option for Galera. And, to complicate things further, this may be a feature of your setup that you, the application developer, don't necessarily have control over.\r\n\r\nIn such a scenario, you may be dealing with very \"interesting\" features of HAproxy which — if you are unfamiliar with them — can throw you very nasty curveballs.\r\n\r\nHaving been in the position where, together with my team, I *was* indeed unfamiliar with some of HAProxy's/Galera's intricacies and we were thus on he receiving end of those curveballs, I am taking this opportunity to share our findings so that our pain is someone else's gain. You have multiple options at your disposal — some in your infrastructure setup, and some in your Django application code. This talk covers both those angles.\n\nProduced by NDV: https://youtube.com/channel/UCQ7dFBzZGlBvtU2hCecsBBg?sub_confirmation=1\n\nPython, PyCon, PyConAU, PyConline\n\nFri Sep  4 13:55:00 2020 at Obvious",

        "description": "Tishampati Dhar\n\nhttps://2020.pycon.org.au/program/ZKKE98\n\nIn Australia we are used to live radar images provided by Bureau on Meterology (BoM). This agency provides forecasting and myriads of other services and has around 500 million in Annual budget. This is not the case in developing countries like Kenya where the last operational weather radar instrument was seen some 30 years ago. \r\n\r\nFrustrated with the lack of live radar while in Nairobi a couple of engineers put together a passive radar system with an SDR and an Intel NUC. The data from this system travels via S3 and DynamoDB from screen capture tools on the endpoint device. Eventually gets exposed via API's to web and mobile apps running on some EC2 boxes ( no fancy kubernetes cluster to see here) . There are also a couple of Cron Jobs acting as Twitter and WhatsApp bots for followers. All this scratching your own itch infrastructure has slowly improved in uptime to 70% and supports around 5000 regular users. The entire data pipeline and web applications are written as set of small Python Services using Flask, OpenCV and ImageMagick.\r\n\r\nThis talk will describe how the pipeline was put together incrementally with intermediate outputs and rapidly deployed using a basic `git pull` based workflow. Along the way we will enumerate the numerous gotchas including the excessive S3 List usage, power failures on sensor site and dogpiling Twitter bots.  The budget for the operations remains 100's of dollars per month.\n\nProduced by NDV: https://youtube.com/channel/UCQ7dFBzZGlBvtU2hCecsBBg?sub_confirmation=1\n\nPython, PyCon, PyConAU, PyConline\n\nFri Sep  4 10:25:00 2020 at Obvious",

There is no such thing as perfect data, yet we treat data with more reverence than it deserves. Our entire education system is built on the idea of being measurable, yet all too often “measurable” winds up being the opposite of “meaningful”. We’ll consider how we got here, and how we can create an education system that focuses on meaningful outcomes, and develops our students into rational, ethical heretics,\r\nAll of these goals require us to get comfortable with the idea of uncertainty. To be prepared to challenge the status quo, query accepted wisdom, and even to question our own findings. We're going to talk about why uncertainty is important, and how we can get comfortable with it, especially in education.\r\nWhy should you take my word for it? I'll show you how data science projects work, with case studies from my own teaching, and examples of units ADSEI has created right across the curriculum, from Humanities to STEM.\n\nProduced by NDV: https://youtube.com/channel/UCQ7dFBzZGlBvtU2hCecsBBg?sub_confirmation=1\n\nPython, PyCon, PyConAU, PyConline\n\nFri Sep  4 12:45:00 2020 at Floperator",

For most mundane tasks, your calculations ‘just work’, and you are not supposed to think too much about it.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time though, the magic stops working. The maths that’s correct on a sheet of paper no longer gives the right results when done on a computer. Results of NaN or Inf, division by zero errors, and inaccurate answers have caused great frustration to many.\r\n\r\nTo see why this happens, we will look under the hood of floating point numbers. Their structure in memory, and how it affects the accuracy of different operations. This is particularly relevant to data science, which entails lots of number crunching.\r\n\r\nWe will see why subtraction is sometimes dangerous, why you should avoid multiplying probabilities, and why you should never invert a matrix. We will explore the tools Python, NumPy, and SciPy give us to avoid these pitfalls, such as LU decomposition and the LogAddExp trick.\n\nProduced by NDV: https://youtube.com/channel/UCQ7dFBzZGlBvtU2hCecsBBg?sub_confirmation=1\n\nPython, PyCon, PyConAU, PyConline\n\nFri Sep  4 12:45:00 2020 at Curlyboi",

        "description": "Sarah Levins\n\nhttps://2020.pycon.org.au/program/E9AXJE\n\nChatbots have become commonplace in our lives. These days, you may find they are largely used as a form of customer service. But how does it make us feel when we know we’re talking to a program? A poor interaction can sour the user’s experience and put them off using a product.\r\n\r\nThere is an art to making programmed responses feel natural. It’s not just about replying to our questions with the correct answer. Chatbots need to be programmed with the same abilities humans have to communicate. They need to be able to listen, understand and remember. This gives them the context of the conversation. So where do you start?\r\n\r\nIn this talk i’ll cover some of the core concepts behind how web chatbots work, strategies used to train them to feel more human, and some Python tools that you can use to start building your own.\n\nProduced by NDV: https://youtube.com/channel/UCQ7dFBzZGlBvtU2hCecsBBg?sub_confirmation=1\n\nPython, PyCon, PyConAU, PyConline\n\nSat Sep  5 11:00:00 2020 at Floperator",

Issues that have been called out in particular are: data privacy, the harm that algorithmic bias can have, and the negative repercussions of unchecked recommendation systems blindly maximising engagement.\r\n\r\nThat ethical AI has become part of the discourse of data and AI is a positive sign, but how do we move from just talk? Who is responsible? What can you do about these issues?\r\n\r\nIn this moderated panel, we'll hear from three experienced data science practitioners on how these issues play out in their professional lives, as well as their perspectives on how we can actively work towards more ethical AI. \r\n\r\nWe hope this discussion will provide a valuable backdrop upon which to reflect throughout the rest of the day as we cover a range of exciting topics in science, data, and analytics.\n\nProduced by NDV: https://youtube.com/channel/UCQ7dFBzZGlBvtU2hCecsBBg?sub_confirmation=1\n\nPython, PyCon, PyConAU, PyConline\n\nFri Sep  4 09:15:00 2020 at Curlyboi",

In this session we will use the latest examples of the COVID19 apps to illustrate how a solution can be technically perfect while being perfectly inappropriate as a solution to a given problem. We will work backwards from the location/data sharing/API changes which were happily adopted for covid apps to illustrate how/when those sorts of opportunities can be seized by governments and malicious third parties. We will cover the ways in which every dataset aggregated and generated is likely to be appropriated and abused. Why does that happen? How can we prevent that at the design stages? I will lean on my extensive history in the field to pull together examples where policy and agencies have grabbed at opportunities like this to seize additional power, and use it to highlight the urgency of addressing this issue as we go through the everyday. We can change the chaotic technosolutionism that happens by being better informed and better prepared to do our jobs with a critical eye.\r\n\r\nThe session should leave the audience with a broader understanding of the challenges posed by one-stop-shop-technosolutionism and the essential questions that we as participants in the tech space have a responsibility for baking into our thinking and decision making.\n\nProduced by NDV: https://youtube.com/channel/UCQ7dFBzZGlBvtU2hCecsBBg?sub_confirmation=1\n\nPython, PyCon, PyConAU, PyConline\n\nFri Sep  4 09:15:00 2020 at Python 2",

        "description": "Gajendra Deshpande\n\nhttps://2020.pycon.org.au/program/GGGTVY\n\nImagine you are passing through an unknown street at midnight and you find that some anti-social elements are following you. To save yourself from them you start running and look for a safe place to hide yourself. On the way, you will find a good person and request the person to help you. The person hides you in the secure place to protect you. When these anti-social elements visit a good person’s place and enquire about you, the good person misguides them and redirects them to some other place in order to protect you. This is exactly how deception works. In this analogy, YOU are the resources to be protected, anti-social elements are the hackers who want to gain access to the resources, and a good person is a deception technique that protects the resources from hackers by making them fall in the trap.\r\n\r\n**How we implemented deception tool in python using machine learning**\r\nWe designed a deception tool in python language using PyBRAIN package to model and mitigate XPath injection attacks for web services. It is known that XML can be used to store the data and this data can be queried using XPath query language. XPath as a query language, it has injection issues similar to SQL. To handle this issue, we proposed a solution, which uses count-based validation technique and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) modular neural networks to identify and classify atypical behavior in user input. Once the atypical user input is identified, the attacker is redirected to fake resources to protect the critical data. Our experiment resulted in over 90% accuracy in classification of input vectors.\n\nProduced by NDV: https://youtube.com/channel/UCQ7dFBzZGlBvtU2hCecsBBg?sub_confirmation=1\n\nPython, PyCon, PyConAU, PyConline\n\nFri Sep  4 13:20:00 2020 at Python 2",

        "description": "Markus Holtermann\n\nhttps://2020.pycon.org.au/program/U9GBBD\n\nWe live in a world of technology and engineering where almost everything around us requires software. Unfortunately, the software we use or build has bugs. While most bugs can \"just\" be fixed, there are these other types of bugs, called vulnerabilities. Vulnerabilities can be found in our own infrastructure, on customers' infrastructure, or — worse — around user data.\r\n\r\nSadly, we see reports of leaked personal data on a daily basis. And when it comes to the companies who just had data leaked, it is astounding how rattled and unprepared they are for the situation. In fact, a lot of companies are puzzled when someone external approaches them about a possible security issue publicly. They don't know how to react and often react in the worst possible way: denial. But it is also about issues that are found from within the company. Issues that may not directly affect personal information. There is more to do than telling customers there is a security release of some software.\r\n\r\nIT security is a sheer endless topic to talk about. It is a mindset and a company culture that must be lived by each and everyone within a company. In this talk, I will point out what roles individual departments play. Because there are more questions to be answered than “how and when are customers informed about an issue and a corresponding solution”. Are details about the issue released, and if so, when, and will the details be released publicly or only to customers? How will a public outcry about an issue on social media be dealt with? Is the social media team equipped to handle the masses? Will the sales and marketing teams be able to handle a hesitant customers base? What legal implications does the issue have? Who coordinates, makes decisions, and stays on top all of these moving parts?\n\nProduced by NDV: https://youtube.com/channel/UCQ7dFBzZGlBvtU2hCecsBBg?sub_confirmation=1\n\nPython, PyCon, PyConAU, PyConline\n\nFri Sep  4 14:30:00 2020 at Python 2",

But when pandemic strikes, is maintaining communities based around connecting with hundreds of like-minded people even possible? Is it even possible to run an online event that upholds our values? And will kids even want to sign up for more hours of online learning?\r\n\r\nI’ll take you through how we devised a plan to keep the GPN spirit alive online, with a dynamic schedule of learning, socialising and fun! I’ll show you the tech that made it all possible, tell you the lessons we learnt along the way, and let you in on some of the things we’ll be keeping in the long term.\n\nProduced by NDV: https://youtube.com/channel/UCQ7dFBzZGlBvtU2hCecsBBg?sub_confirmation=1\n\nPython, PyCon, PyConAU, PyConline\n\nFri Sep  4 09:15:00 2020 at Floperator",
