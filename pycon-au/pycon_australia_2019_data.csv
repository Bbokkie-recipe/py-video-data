In some ways, a browser engine seems to have little in common with a web
framework. But both are ambitious software projects, approached by large
groups of diverse people trying and sometimes failing to cooperate,
collaborate, and code together. This talk shares firsthand observations,
collected over 3 years of working within the Rust and Servo teams at Mozilla
as well as volunteering on the Rust Community Team, about what all developers
can learn from Rust's approaches to the universal challenges of code and
community.

The numerical Python ecosystem and communities are mature and powerful, but sometimes we can be too quick to reach for the numerical hammer when simpler options exist. This talk will outline some areas where the numerical stack may not be the best starting point, and survey some alternatives.

RAPIDS open-source software enables end-to-end data science and analytics pipelines to run entirely on GPUs. Key to RAPIDS is cuDF, a pandas-like Python data frame library with a high-performance CUDA C++ implementation. cuDF and RAPIDS enable large speedups for end-to-end data science using GPUs.

With torch and tensorflow we have begun to rely on GPUs to speed up
computations. Deep Learning or not, GPUs can provide massive computation speed
ups but it's not a panacea as NVIDIA would have you believe. Understanding how
GPUs work can tell us where we should and shouldn't use them.

COBOL was one of the first business-oriented programming languages, showing up in the 1960s. It’s also regarded as one of the worst languages in which to work. But is that true? And if so, what could ever take its place as the most reviled thing in dev?
