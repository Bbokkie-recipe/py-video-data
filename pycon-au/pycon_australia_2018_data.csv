So many of the things we build depend on a DBMS to keep our data safe, and retrieve it quickly.
We know indexes can make that faster, but... how do they work? When should you use them? What should I index?

Python has a surprisingly large number of task queue libraries, but Celery reigns supreme. Unfortunately, there are a few use cases where it's remarkably bad. Learn about why you might want a task queue (and when you definitely don't), when Celery is appropriate, and what you can do when it's not.

Are you completely over those fragile and complicated integration test? There is another way!
Pact is a contract testing tool used to ensure services can communicate with each other. May be used between an API server and web frontend but really shines in an environment with many services.

They make your code look great, and they're now easier to write than ever thanks to contextlib! Come get contextual!

Have you ever wanted someone else to write your test cases? There’s a library for that!

You declare a strategy for inputs - from ‘an integer’ to ‘matching this regex’ to ‘Django model’; Hypothesis finds bugs and reports minimal failing examples. Too good to be true? Come see for yourself!

Good written communication can make your systems easier to use and maintain,
encourage your colleagues to be more receptive to your suggestions, and make
you more popular on the internet. I’ll share some practical ways to communicate
more effectively, and some less practical theory about how people and language

Coding is a creative process. But we don’t really learn about creativity, usually it's all exception handling and Big O complexity. This talk is about introspection and calm coding in the face of long stack traces. Also, I'll be doing a live watercolour painting at the same time.

Python is a great beginners programming language. Unfortunately, many of the exception messages coming from the standard library and parser are very unhelpful to a newbie programmer. We identify some of these cases, make modifications to improve these messages, and assess their effectiveness.

LED lighting rigs are expensive. Worse, they have little to no controls aside from on/off. Most are not dimmable and changing colors requires the use of gels. In this talk I will discuss how CircuitPython was used in conjunction with LEDs and microcontrollers to make a custom LED photo lighting rig.

Data Science is the tag of choice for grant applications, project proposals,

out that data science is crucial to our lives and the future of the planet.
It’s also a fun, easy, and motivating way to teach kids programming and give
them the chance to make a real difference in the world. So let’s talk about
using Python and real datasets to take over the world, and, incidentally,
teach STEM.
