1,Dependency management: the cause of—and solution to—all supply chain problems,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JGH2g1a3PM,6JGH2g1a3PM,PyCon AU,@PyConAU,https://www.youtube.com/@PyConAU,20241203,1799,618,15,,"NickyRingland,pyconau,pyconau_2024",Education,"(Nicky Ringland) How many dependencies does your software project have? How much confidence do you have in them? We sometimes say in open source there is safety in ‘eyes on the code’, but with supply chain attacks on the rise, who is really watching?

Most software is built with hundreds if not thousands of direct and transitive dependencies, and those dependencies change every day. Our analysis shows that up to 20% of PyPI packages change their dependency graphs multiple times per week. Ensuring that each one of these dependencies is trustworthy is a daunting task.

In this talk, we will share some stats and stories from building deps.dev. We will look at what it means for a project to be healthy, dig into the complexities of dependency resolution algorithms, and recommend tools that can make practical dependency management possible if not easy.

With a recent interest in phylogeny – the science of evolution, diversification, and speciation – these are the kinds of questions I've been asking myself. I wanted to find a tool that would let me examine the relationships between species and find the answers to these questions, but, as I looked around I couldn't find anything that did what I wanted. So I made it myself.

Come with me as I share my journey that led me to talk to some of Australia's top scientists, give up on talking to other top scientists, and accidentally stumble my way into making an actual contribution to science. Learn why I made this tool, how I made this tool, what stage it's at, and where you can use it yourself. And maybe learn some things about life on Earth along the way.

Expectations are high, and there’s a lot to take into account. I recently developed an open source package. This talk covers what worked, what didn’t work, what I would do again and what I would do differently.

I developed an open source package called “scores” ( https://github.com/nci/scores , https://scores.readthedocs.io/ ).  This is not a presentation about what “scores” does, but instead covers the lessons I learned. Despite being an experienced software developer and having used lots of open source software, there was still a lot to learn (and a lot to figure out) about open source package maintenance.

Every package is different, but this is what I did and these are the lessons I learned. 

- Technical Matters:
    - How to lay things out on disk
    - Configuration files
    - Automated testing
    - Type hinting
    - Linting and other static analysis tools
    - Code layout and design
- Documentation:
    - What documentation to produce
    - Picking and using a tech stack
    - Rendering (documentation often renders differently in different locations)
- Ecosystem Integration:
    - How to fit in well with the tools around you
    - Versioning 
    - Publishing to PyPI
    - How and what to automate
    - How to do releases
- Community Considerations:
    - Code review standards
    - Clear presentation of information
    - Understanding your user base and audience

Causal discovery means learning ""what causes what"" from your data. The input is a tabular dataset; the output is a causal graphical model (or a set of potential models) over your features. If feature A affects feature B, there should be an arrow A-→B in the causal graphical model. Causal discovery is useful for hypothesis generation, experiment selection, and for testing our assumptions around causation.

I'll give a brief intro to causal discovery, then review the following packages: py-tetrad, causal-learn, tigramite, causalnex, and cdt (causal discovery toolbox). The packages have some overlap but different emphases: each one implements at least one algorithm not covered by the other packages, making them useful in different situations. If time permits I'll finish with a quick demo, showing each package learning a model from the same dataset.

The first section will provide this context and background - describing the anatomy of an optimisation problem, and what the model building process looks like. We will touch on the characteristics common to optimisation problems seen across multiple industries.

We will then build a simple optimisation model together, demonstrating how the model building process compares to the machine learning approach.

Finally, we will end by exploring some of the most fascinating applications of mathematical optimisation in industry, focussing on the characteristics that the audience can map to challenges that are specific to their own industry.

11,Introducing Potnia: A Python language library for the conversion of ancient texts to Unicode,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7h4G53etywI,7h4G53etywI,PyCon AU,@PyConAU,https://www.youtube.com/@PyConAU,20241201,1768,690,16,,"EmilyTour,KabirManandharShrestha,pyconau,pyconau_2024",Education,"(Emily Tour, Kabir Manandhar Shrestha) The last five years have seen a significant increase in the application of machine learning to the study of ancient scripts. Applications are broad, and include recognition via Optical Character Recognition (OCR), textual restoration, palaeographic analysis, topic modelling, representation learning, decipherment and machine translation (Sommerschield 2023). A large number of ancient language corpora have been digitised in recent decades, supporting this research. However, while the necessary Unicode blocks for many of these ancient scripts are available, a number of these data sets are still presented as Romanised transliterations.

In response to this situation, we have created Potnia (https://pypi.org/project/potnia/), an open-source Python language library under the Apache 2.0 license, designed to convert such transliterated texts to Unicode. The session image accompanying this proposal provides an example of Potnia’s conversion process, with a Romanised transliteration of a Linear B text as the input, and the Unicode representation of this same text as the output. This conversion is crucial for downstream machine learning tasks, as tokenisation in the original Unicode script allows for more accurate representation of linguistic structures and mitigates potential biases introduced by transliteration.

Potnia's flexible architecture, built on Python's object-oriented principles, employs string manipulation techniques and regular expressions to handle various complexities inherent in ancient texts, such as uncertain readings, missing elements, and script-specific notations. At present, the library can be used for Linear B texts, with functionality for Linear A, Sumerian and Akkadian soon to follow.

Potnia's design allows for easy addition of new scripts, each with its own set of rules for tokenisation, regularisation, and character mapping. This extensibility positions us well for future inclusion of additional scripts. To ensure reliability and facilitate open-source contributions, we've implemented a comprehensive test suite using pytest, with test cases defined in YAML files for easy expansion. This approach covers key functionalities across different scripts and simplifies the process of adding new test scenarios as the library grows.

This talk will pose some critical questions concerning current approaches of choosing and implementing data catalogs:


- Do you actually need a Data catalog?
- Are data catalogs becoming just glorified registries without much practical use?
- Why do organisations find themselves juggling multiple catalogs?
- Is there a synergy between System Catalog & Data Catalog?
- How do you identify the right fit and what are the considerations?
- How to measure success for a data catalog?

We'll dissect the reasons behind these challenges and share our experience of implementing data catalogs across different organisations.

They chose Django, even though two of them had no prior experience with the framework. Nevertheless, the project became a success, affirming that choosing Django was a great technical decision.

This is a real-life story about the challenges the team faced while scaling the project and changing the database architecture, all while maintaining uninterrupted services for millions of customers. We will cover some of the key technical decisions the team made, how Django supported us in migrating from a single database to a multi-database architecture, and examine the architectural benefits of using multiple databases in data-intensive applications.

The Pandas package has been dominant in Python for around 15 years but its design is now showing its age. There is now a vibrant and messy ecosystem of potential disruptors to the status quo for data analysis tasks in Python.

This talk will help you make sense of the mess. It will give you a comprehensive review of the strengths and weaknesses of the challengers, including Polars, Ibis, Vaex, Modin, Dask, and the PySpark Pandas API (formerly known as Koalas). It will also review efforts to unify the PyData landscape such as Apache Arrow, the dataframe interchange protocol, Narwhals, and the Ibis project from the original author of Pandas, Wes McKinney.

19,"""The perfect setup? Not setup.py! Building packages the right way"" - Caleb Brown (Pycon AU 2024)",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JC5Dex47vxo,JC5Dex47vxo,PyCon AU,@PyConAU,https://www.youtube.com/@PyConAU,20241201,1817,1112,44,,"CalebBrown,pyconau,pyconau_2024",Education,"(Caleb Brown) Everyone loves package management! Python's packaging systems have continued to evolve over the years. Specifications such as environment markers, custom backends, and static build configurations have been introduced. Additionally new package managers like Poetry and Hatch have emerged.

Yet despite the updates, many projects are still living in the 2010s - using a setup.py file to specify the build configuration for their package. setup.py is notoriously difficult to learn and a common vector for launching attacks during install.

This talk will discuss why it's time to move away from using setup.py and how to do it.

We will see how setup.py is used and abused - from downloading huge datasets (*cough* AI *cough*), modifying the system, and most critically how malicious payloads can be included to execute when setup.py is evaluated. Arbitrary code in setup.py makes security analysis harder and creates more work for PyPI administrators.

The talk will detail the new (as of 7 years ago) methods for describing build configurations in pyproject.toml, giving examples of how to use them. The examples will include how to achieve what once required dynamic code to include data like readme contents, version numbers and requirements. The limits of pyproject.toml will also be covered.

Finally, the talk will outline how moving away from setup.py improves the Python packaging universe, how it makes life easier for ensuring Python security, and what can be done to drive adoption of pyproject.toml.

But how do machines, which fundamentally operate on binary code, achieve such remarkable feats? The answer lies in embeddings. Embeddings allow us to represent complex data - whether it's text, images, or even abstract concepts - as dense vectors of numbers. In this presentation, we'll demystify embeddings and give you a practical and intuitive understanding of how they work.

This intriguing question drives our study as we delve into the complexities of translation.

We examine how sentiment analysis results differ for the same text in various languages, aiming to understand the role of language families in these variations. Using natural language processing techniques in Python, we analyse novels from diverse genres, time periods, and cultural backgrounds to uncover generalisable translation patterns.

Our study seeks to answer whether translations of words, ideas, and societal contexts in novels are influenced by the cultural contexts into which they are translated. By highlighting the importance of accurate and culturally relevant translations, we emphasise how they play a crucial role in preserving cultural and societal knowledge, ensuring that the richness of the original text is maintained across languages.

There are many challenges here, not least which is enabling the approximately 150,000 primary school teachers with the skills and resources to teach programming to young students.  The AustSTEM foundation was set up to assist in this area, and developed a MicroPython based learning platform, which consists of a pocket-sized computing device that integrates with a web-based coding and teaching environment.  The teaching material has many hands-on activities, with connections to nature and science.  In this talk we will discuss this teaching platform, how it can help students transition from block-based programming to textual coding, and show some of the successes we have had so far in Australian classrooms.

However, a gap analysis in the teaching methodology has highlighted conceptual computational thinking and problem-solving skills as a key gap in the current offering. This was attributed to the curriculum's skills-based focus and the Covid-era teaching practice of flipped learning via video tutorials.  

This has presented an opportunity to overhaul the teaching methodology to focus on equipping students with the skills to apply their learning in different contexts.  Some key aspects of this transformation include a more live coding technique and transitioning to Python as the preferred programming language, due to its versatility and future prospects for students.  

We present this roadmap which leads to a complete overhaul of our teaching programmes from year 7 to year 12, scaffolding Python across Applied Computing, STEM projects, Robotics and Game development over the next 6 months.

Want to write less code? This talk may be for you! 

REST API's are ubiquitious, and a very useful way to send and recieve data from various services. However, building them can often feel repetitive and boring. So, because I was lazy, and sick of doing it I decided to override specific dunder methods to write less boiler plate code, and keep myself interested.

Was it easier? Probably not. Did it require less work than a normal implementation? Also probably not. Did it make my code more readable and portable? Definitely not. But it was fun, and I learnt how overriding Python's magic methods - often called dunders - could be useful. Let me share the lessons I learnt with you and inspire your own ideas.

Given a complex dataset, they may feel tempted to use simple summary statistics like the mean, median, or standard deviation to describe it. However, these numbers are not a replacement for visualizing the distribution.

To illustrate this fact, researchers have generated many datasets that are very different visually, but share the same summary statistics. In this talk, I will discuss *Data Morph*, an open source package that builds on previous research using simulated annealing to perturb an arbitrary input dataset into a variety of shapes, while preserving the mean, standard deviation, and correlation to multiple decimal points. I will showcase how it works, discuss the challenges faced during development, and explore the limitations of this approach.

They require careful discipline to prevent problems like target leakage, over-fitting or p-hacking. Typically, data scientists use custom workflows, or proprietary cloud systems to automate and standardise certain elements like management of data sets, scripts, model artefacts and results. The result is a general absence of both standardisation and easy migration of processes for flexible and repeatable data science work.

In this talk we will outline a light weight open source python package that can be used to manage project meta-data in a way that allows easy sharing, migration and collaboration for data scientists working in the python ecosystem. We will discuss some of the design principles, inspired by a combination of the UNIX command line and the git source control utility. We will then demonstrate basic usage of the package with examples from scientific research papers it has been used for.

It's the kind of environment that is hard to think too much ahead, and for that reason, our database was created to address the problems we had at hand. 
After a while, new products and features were required, and our database couldn't handle all of them. That’s when we decided to move our data to a newly designed database instance with proper relationships, able to handle more features, higher workloads and scalable. During the planning phase, several approaches were discussed, such as creating a script to copy the data and some off-the-shelf software that we thought could handle that for us. However, the complexity of implementing those approaches wasn’t feasible with our deadlines for releasing the new product. So, we decided to copy the data using Django ORM (our product was already using Django), the idea was to avoid the complexity of creating complex SQL Queries to copy data to new tables while keeping the data consistency and integrity.
In this presentation, we aim to demonstrate how our database was limiting the company’s scalability and how we fixed those problems by migrating to a new database schema whilst maintaining two database instances, one for internal operations and the other for customer-facing functions. Moreover, we show how we did that using object-oriented programming in combination with Django’s ORM to migrate our database without the need to handle complex SQL commands to copy data, keep relationships, and create new ones.

63,"""Astronomy with Python, for non-astronomers"" - Andrew Williams (Pycon AU 2024)",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9wWCbdcQl0,o9wWCbdcQl0,PyCon AU,@PyConAU,https://www.youtube.com/@PyConAU,20241127,1651,371,13,,"AndrewWilliams,pyconau,pyconau_2024",Education,"(Andrew Williams) Astronomers have been dealing with digital data since the 1980s and online databases 
since the early 90's, and now, almost all research astronomers use Python to access and 
process that data. Most astronomical database are open to the public, and most research
software tools are either open source, or freely available.  I'll give an intro, aimed at 
non-astronomers, to some Python packages (astropy, skyfield) and online research tools.

This talk will give an overview on what tools and databases are available and how to access 
them. Maybe you're writing a game, and you want the 3D locations and properties of the 
nearest 10,000 stars (or extrasolar planets, or galaxies). Maybe you're building a Solar
panel that tracks the Sun, or a camera mount that tracks the International Space
Station. Maybe you're trying to model shadow lengths and directions in satellite images. Or
maybe you just want to play around with real telescope images that haven't had a PR 
department make them 'prettier'...

But napari can also: overlay derived data, such as points, segmentations, polygons, surfaces, and more; and annotate and edit these data, using standard data structures like NumPy or Zarr arrays, allowing you to seamlessly weave exploration, computation, and annotation in image analysis.

68,From minutes to seconds: Capillary auto-alignment with python and opencv,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA7RugeYOoM,NA7RugeYOoM,PyCon AU,@PyConAU,https://www.youtube.com/@PyConAU,20241126,1625,178,8,,"EmilyMassahud,pyconau,pyconau_2024",Education,"(Emily Massahud) Samples used for diffraction experiments at the Australian Synchrotron, a research facility in Melbourne, are typically presented as finely ground powders confined inside very thin (1mm or less) glass capillaries. These samples are irradiated with X-rays in order to uncover their atomic crystal structures. Amongst our research areas, we study applications in mining, solar cells, perovskites, hydrogen storage, and geology, where understanding material properties at the atomic level can lead to advancements such as enhancing mineral extraction processes, improving solar cell efficiency, developing better hydrogen storage solutions, and analysing the composition of meteorites.

To ensure good data quality, the capillary needs to rotate precisely around its centre of rotation in front of the X-ray beam. Alignment of the centre of rotation is usually a manual operation that relies on the human eye and expertise to discern that the capillary is straight and stationary while it rotates around its axis; this process can be lengthy, error-prone, and difficult to achieve, especially for non-experts.

In this talk, I will demonstrate how we have united Python, OpenCV, and motion control systems to automate the capillary alignment procedure at the Australian Synchrotron, reducing the time to align a sample from several minutes to just 10 seconds.

Was your model architecture wrong? Could you have picked a better learning rate? Stuck in a local optimum? How to know? 

The best way out of the swamp of confusion was to know what you were shooting for. What was a reasonable limit for how good an answer you could get? So we built benchmarks.  Unfortunately, a lot of teams working with both traditional and generative AI techniques today aren’t using realistic benchmarks to draw a line in the sand and say ‘we’re aiming for this’. 

Let's take a look at why you don't, why you should and how to go about it.

70,"Verifying and evaluating scientific results with the open source package ""scores""",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyq2jOqtXe0,jyq2jOqtXe0,PyCon AU,@PyConAU,https://www.youtube.com/@PyConAU,20241126,1505,176,3,,"TennesseeLeeuwenburg,pyconau,pyconau_2024",Education,"(Tennessee Leeuwenburg) Verifying, evaluating or interpreting complex data requires specialist tools and methods. Many data scientists, programmers and scientists will be familiar with some evaluation metrics such as accuracy, mean squared error or true positive rate. There are many situations where these scores are insufficient for assessing correctness, accuracy or suitability of a model or prediction. The challenge of verifying models and predictions affects most fields of science, engineering, and many machine learning applications.

This talk will introduce ""scores"", an open source Python package for verifying and evaluating labelled, n-dimensional (multidimensional) data at any scale. ""scores"" includes over 50 metrics, statistical techniques and data processing tools. The software repository can be found at https://github.com/nci/scores and the documentation can be found at https://scores.readthedocs.io/ .

This talk is suitable for beginner, intermediate and expert audiences. Developers and data scientists who are familiar mainly with tabular data, such as supported by the pandas library, may be interested in the additional functionality offered by ""scores"" (and the xarray library it utilises). For those learning about more advanced methods, every metric and statistical test has a companion Jupyter Notebook tutorial. For expert users already familiar with these ideas, you may be interested in some of the novel scoring methods not commonly found in other packages. 

Come to this talk to hear about:

 - The difference between tabular data, n-dimensional data, and labelled n-dimensional data
 - Examples of using a common metric from ""scores"" on labelled, n-dimensional data
 - Examples of using ""scores"" for interrogating data in multiple dimensions
 - Examples of where basic methods overlook important considerations
 - Examples of using some of the more complex metrics in ""scores""

So how can we make learning to program easier for our students? 

This talk will explore concepts from the literature such as the constructivist theory of education, Bloom’s taxonomy and the worked example effect and discuss how they can be applied to different teaching strategies to help students learn more effectively. Drawing on my own teaching experiences, I will provide some examples of how these concepts can inform teaching practices and guide the development of resources for teaching programming.

The goal of this talk is to encourage other educators to reflect on their own teaching strategies and to consider new approaches that they could implement in their classrooms, whether it be through minor tweaks or a complete redevelopment of their teaching materials.

I therefore decided to streamline some of my assignment marking using Python. The time I spent in developing the Python scripts could then be offset by the efficiency and accuracy I gained from the automation. 

In this presentation, I will demonstrate how to populate student details into their individual Excel mark sheets, check marking mistakes, automate mark adjustment and collect data from individual mark sheets. 

While the above automation can be achieved using standard tools offered by Microsoft by putting the programming logic into Excel formulae or Visual Basic for Application, I will argue using Python to separate the logic from data is a better approach in terms of programming practice and Cybersecurity.

76,How I Used Python to Stop Worrying & Love Emoji in Bioinformatics,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3-AooF8e2k,E3-AooF8e2k,PyCon AU,@PyConAU,https://www.youtube.com/@PyConAU,20241126,1414,271,14,,"AndrewLonsdale,pyconau,pyconau_2024",Education,"(Andrew Lonsdale) Bioinformatics is the science of understanding and analysing biological information, such as the genetic information contained in DNA. It combines the disciplines of biology, computer science, and mathematics. If this seems daunting, don’t panic, because this talk will focus on two open-source Python packages I have developed, FASTQE and Biomojify, that make common bioinformatics file formats intuitive and accessible…. by using emoji.

FASTQE simplifies DNA sequencing data analysis by taking numerical quality scores for the data, and summarising them using emoji to quickly convey the good, the bad, and the ugly of sequence data quality. Whether for training, outreach, or debugging, this tool can easily turn unremarkable data quality analysis into an appealing visualisation.

Biomojify takes the concept further by converting plain text data to use emoji. In DNA, for example, the conventional format represents  individual A, C, G, and T nucleotides as plain text. Biomojify substitutes them with emojis such as avocado, cheese, grape, and tomato. It supports various bioinformatics file formats and supports user defined emoji mapping. It can be used to teach the underlying biological concepts behind bioinformatics data, by simplifying specialised data structures for a general audience. 

Science communication is hard. These tools transform complex bioinformatics data into engaging, emoji-based visualisations, making bioinformatics concepts more accessible and adding an element of fun to scientific education and communication.

Beginners may also lack confidence or are easily demotivated, which can hinder learning. To assist students in developing these skills and build confidence we created a set of playful programming challenges and competition using Karel the Robot. The Karel system provides a 2D “grid world” where the Karel character can move and interact with its environment. The 2D world is visualised for students so that they can immediately see how their program changes the environment step by step as well as the final program state. This is in contrast to traditional languages where learners must develop and maintain a mental model of the program state. This talk will cover our approach, preliminary results and feedback from students showing an increase in confidence and interest in programming. We will also share how this approach can be applied to other learning contexts.
