This will be a tour of FastAPI, Pydantic, pyproj and some other interesting modern tooling -- this talk is aimed towards people who don’t know about these things but are curious about maybe using them or at least seeing how they’re used IRL.

We’re responsible for the darling golden child of data.gov.au, its most popular dataset: **G-NAF**, the monster-scale National Address File. We make sure this data (and a bunch of its buddies) are delivered via API to all who wants it as fast and accurately as possible every day and we use mostly python tooling to do it. It’s a fun and Australia-centric data-palooza.

It's diagnostics! A data efficient technique for seeing how well your system is running in real time.

What isn't so well known is that diagnostics can be embedded directly into your python application. Doing it this way provides a purely on-demand and human-readable interface of real-time system state and performance.

Compared to a sequence of log messages, diagnostics are certainly more difficult to implement. After all, logging is essentially just some well-placed print statements, outputted to a file or third-party logging agent. 

But this type of logging can be expensive, bandwidth intensive and hard to make sense of. Have you ever had to trawl through pages and pages of logs just to check your application is working well? 

In this talk, you will learn a number of practical and pythonic techniques for serving custom diagnostics from within your application.

Ten years later MicroPython is a mature open-source project that is relied upon by a wide variety of users.  In this talk I will discuss its history, my experiences maintaining it as an open source project, and some of the interesting places MicroPython has found itself in.

The Python community has long celebrated simplicity as a virtue, but Python has grown, the features that make Python simple in small programs don’t matter as much.

In this talk, we’ll explore how the Python community used to think about simplicity, how we think about simplicity now that Python is used for ever more complex tasks, and consider whether “simple is better than complex” is advice that Pythonistas can meaningfully follow.

I posit that we all experience gender slightly differently, just like we experience color slightly differently. Therefore, I built an online project using Python and Flask to classify people as individual colors rather than genders, to create a tapestry of gender. and show gender as a literal, individual, spectrum.

Eclarin) With all the hype about applications that uses machine learning, I think there is one key aspect that developers tend to forget: **""Performance check and monitoring""**.

ML and AI services have become very accessible and can be integrated into any application you can think of. But what do you do after you integrated your ML models to your application? ‹u›How do you know that the output of the ML models are correct and up to standard? What are the signs that the model's performance is changing and how do you take action on such changes? ‹/u›

Typically, these problems are just discussed on a theoretical and research level. But how can we carry over these techniques and apply it to our application? Not just that, how can we make it so that monitoring and performance check is as simple as writing a unit test (or not).

In this session, we will learn some simple but effective ways on model performance monitoring as well as look at some python implementation and architecture consideration.

This talk will aim to answer at least some of the questions you may have if you’re starting out with or looking to scale up your use of PySpark when working with data. This will be a mix of useful intro hints mixed with more technical backing, including a peek into what goes on behind the API and some common issues I’ve run into so that you can hopefully spend slightly less time getting frustrated by them.

So whether you’re prepping for your next data engineering interview or are just curious about what might be going on in one small corner of the world of data, you’ll hopefully leave this talk feeling a bit more confident taking your next steps with big data.

30,Collaborative Programming in the Classroom: Approaches and Insights,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21mLjpstsX0,21mLjpstsX0,PyCon AU,@PyConAU,https://www.youtube.com/@PyConAU,20230822,1888,136,0,,"AlisonWong,StephenTierney,pyconau,pyconau_2023",Education,"(Stephen Tierney, Alison Wong) Collaborative learning in the classroom has been shown to have a broad range of positive academic effects such as promotion of critical thinking, communication skills and improved learning outcomes. It also brings social and psychological benefits such as development of friendships, social support, reduced anxiety and increased appreciation for the course content.

Unlike a traditional classroom, programming education tends to offer few opportunities for group activities as students tend to be restricted to their personal laptops  or to allocated workstations and are expected to learn in relative isolation. This is often due to environmental factors, such as it being hard to share a keyboard between more than two students at a time. Additionally, educators often design solo activities, because they are easy to implement and execute in the classroom. Since programming students aren’t trained to code with other people, they do not develop clear ideas on what good collaborations look like or how to collaborate with others successfully, which is an important skill in the workforce.

Pair programming is an oft cited solution, yet sharing workstations can be unsatisfying as one student is left in the backseat while the other drives. The situation is worsened for larger group sizes. Furthermore, there is no ability for a group of students to divide and conquer a problem as their attention and input must be the same as the driver.

This talk will introduce approaches to collaborative programming that extend beyond pair programming by allowing more than two students to collaborate in real-time on projects ranging from single Python scripts, to multi-file projects and Jupyter Notebooks. This has been accomplished across pairs, small groups, and even entire classrooms during both live classroom environments and for long-term group projects. We will also discuss the lessons we learnt along the way, as well as feedback from other educators and students.

31,"""Assurance of Learning Through Testing"" - Stephen Tierney, Alison Wong (PyCon AU 2023)",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Xwqcjcbxkc,7Xwqcjcbxkc,PyCon AU,@PyConAU,https://www.youtube.com/@PyConAU,20230822,1719,80,2,,"AlisonWong,StephenTierney,pyconau,pyconau_2023",Education,"(Stephen Tierney, Alison Wong) Programming education increasingly centres around tools that offer automatic marking of student progress through a set of exercises. Automated marking has become increasingly popular as it allows instructors to provide personalised feedback to students in real-time and is easily scalable to large cohorts. It can also be used to provide instructors with detailed insight into the class progression.

While this brings many new advantages it also creates new problems. Chief amongst those is the difficulty of marking long, dynamic and interactive programs which places a large burden on educators to develop sophisticated marking systems.

At the more extreme end of the problem, we may be faced with students who want to take shortcuts such as hard-coding, or using Python’s built-in functionality and third party packages, which may violate the spirit of the exercise. As a result these students may not be achieving learning outcomes.

In this talk we will discuss and demonstrate practical approaches to the aforementioned problems that all educators can use to simplify marking and to increase their assurance of learning. We will also discuss current limitations that we face and provide recommendations to those wishing to apply these approaches.

with an awesome program.  But as that program ages and grows its like a child with 
untied shoe laces. Which is where type hints come in - type hints are easy to use, will 
help tie up laces and continually check that they don't come undone again.

34,How Python is supporting Australia’s energy transition to 100% renewable,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH70Kk5ZUXY,wH70Kk5ZUXY,PyCon AU,@PyConAU,https://www.youtube.com/@PyConAU,20230822,1837,624,10,,"JoshJames,PeterAych,pyconau,pyconau_2023",Education,"(Peter Aych, Josh James) Australia’s electricity grid is transitioning to 100% renewable and the industry’s goal is to be able to run in this configuration by 2025.

This is a huge engineering and organizational undertaking, and Python is supporting us all the way.

This talk shall start with an overview of the energy grid as it has been pretty much for a century. We shall look at the physics of electricity and the control systems required to maintain constant, reliable supply.

Management of the grid involving the movement of large volumes of data from sensors in the field, to centralized data stores. Data is merged with models and used to make operational decision in near real time, to design the grid into the future, and to analyse faults in the past.

Python is used to support these data flows and models and executes in a high availability environment on servers, as well as on users’ desktops supporting ad hoc analysis.

With every line of new code, Python becomes more critical to Australia’s energy future.

We shall cover three broad topics:

a) A little power system engineering: How the grid works.
b) Case study: Modeling the grid in Python with code fragments.
b) Case study: The weather (sunny? windy? hot? cold?) and social (weekend, weekday, public holiday) aspect of forecasting supply and demand.

Put simply, they are: Black, iSort, PyLint, MyPy, PyTest and Coverage.

When used regularly as part of your code – test – commit – push cycle, these tools combine to improve the quality of your Python code. No more will your team argue about trite matters of coding style freeing up their creativity for issues of design that truly matter.

widely used programming languages, including prominence in many domains from
web apps to machine learning. While there is never going to be any single
explanation of why or how Python reached this point, Python's past can help
inform our collective future. In this talk I will introduce a novel Python
tool for interactive text analytics to tell a recent history of Python, as
seen through the Python questions and answers on Stack Overflow.

These services can be scaled to millions of users. However, a myriad of problems comes hidden with it during the development phase if observability-driven development is not followed like the inability to meet the SLAs, poor performance, difficulty in tracking business metrics, etc and this can lead to anti-patterns in software.

Metrics such as these can be valuable for root cause analysis, driving business goals, component-level monitoring, improving performance, and so on. In this presentation, I will discuss how to adhere to best practices for observability and reliability when building a Python service from the ground up. I will explain the meaning of each concept, how to establish a culture that promotes these practices and provide a detailed code walkthrough demonstrating how to implement these concepts effectively.

""Music was better in my day"". As a parent of teenagers, I'm pretty sure I've even said it. But who's right? Which decade's pop music is linguisitcally more interesting, and is there a trend? Using Python and some text analysis I will attempt to answer these questions and more. By the end of the talk all will be revealed... and we can happily sing along to some pop songs safe in the knowledge that they are linguisitcally superior.

We all know that, but it's hard to know what to do about it. Documenting everything is well-intentioned, but it's often too detailed or too tedious to be effective. So what's the solution?

Code.

Using code to spell out the expectations between data producers and data teams can help to ensure that everyone is on the same page and that the data is of the highest quality. This approach is ambitious, but it has the potential to change the way we collaborate and instil confidence in our data.

I'll share my experiences with this approach, including the challenges and the wins. I hope you'll join me in exploring this new way of working with data.

But, GitHub has more to offer teachers and students than just version control (although the peace of mind of knowing that those major works are safe and secure on the cloud is a big bonus!). 

I’ll tell you why using Git is just like an Instagram-worthy shopping trip, and with this analogy and some tools using GitHub will soon be child's play. I’ll also show you the tools for teachers to help keep your students on track, from project templates to documentation, and automated testing with GitHub Actions and some quick Python scripts.

The Australian National University’s Software Innovation Institute is collaborating with Gurriny Yealamucka Health Service (Gurriny) in the Yarrabah Indigenous community of North Queensland, Australia, to build privacy focused data infrastructure and associated software applications called the Solid Health System which will provide individuals with storage, ownership, and control over their own health data.  This model is using Social Linked Data (Solid) technology, a decentralised data storage specification for software application development, using open standards mostly developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Open source Solid server provides users with a secure online storage space called a personal online datastore (POD) to store their own data with granular control of data sharing using data access control policies to provision a trust-no-one environment. Cross-platform software applications are being developed with the Dart and Flutter framework to interact with PODS on a data pipeline built with Python.

Potable and sewer water networks are critical infrastructure to achieve this globally. In Australia, the annual industrial expenditure on potable and sewer water services is around 4.5 billion AUD. Managing and maintaining a calm water network is important from a consumer, environment and government perspective. Over the past few years, major water utilities across Australia have exponentially  added data collection through deployment of a wide range of IoT devices across the potable and sewer water networks. However, currently, this data is rarely used to effectively create insights to enable decision support that transforms productivity, reduces cost and minimises risk.

At Spiral Data, we focus on developing Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) tools towards creating these insights and decision support across the water industry. In this talk, we will discuss two important use cases that were designed, developed and deployed using our python base tech stack through our cloud partner (AWS).

1. Identifying blockages in gravity sewer systems
Blockages can happen especially in sewer networks and large blockages can have major environmental impact. However, detecting blockages is difficult since there are no current alarms or alerts. In this use case, we will discuss how we use AI/ML approaches to identify blockages in networks that can then raise an alert. This in turn can in turn enable support crew to address the blockage in a timely manner. These alerts can also enable operations teams to effectively plan around their limited budget and human capacity.

2. Identifying high speed pressure changes in potable water network to monitor pipe failures
Potable water networks, especially in large metro areas can experience recurrent large pressure changes (transients). This can be due to users (ex: fire testing) or it can be network induced (ex: valves/pump operation). These pressure transients can cause unexpected failures and as a result monitoring them is of pressing importance. However these data are collected at very high rates and as a result it cannot be analyzed at scale by humans. At SpiralData, we are building automated solutions using AI/ML to identify, analyze and group these high speed pressure transients. This in turn becomes a valuable tool to pursue field investigations to identify source and to also plan better for capex expenses.

And moving even further, there is the possibility of extending our work not only locally but also helping communities all around the globe. In this talk, we will discuss ways we can cooperate within the Python community in movements  that can be done both locally and outside our country on a voluntary basis.

Regex can be a powerful fuzzy text processing tool. But large data starts to show how regex can be slow. This talk will examine some of the reasons why regex can be slow, and what can be done to improve performance.

Many of the techniques covered are also applicable in other programming tools that use regex.

This is _not_ an introduction to regex talk; an understanding of basic regex, and regex in Python, is assumed.

First, it presents the importance of trusted data pipelines by testing data quality. It then discusses what we need to test data quality, from high levels (like tables, relations, …) to low levels (like rows and columns). After that, I will show how to implement these tests using different Dbt packages like dbt-utils and dbt-expectations.

Finally, a demo with a complete ELT workflow will be presented. In this demo, Dagster is used as a data pipeline orchestrator, and Dbt is utilized for data transformation with its related testing packages. These transformed pipelines sit on top of Duckdb, which acts as a small data warehouse. This demo is published in a GitHub repository, allowing developers to clone and run the demo independently. 

The talk will help data and analytics engineers build more robust tests for their data pipelines. These trusted data pipelines could enhance the data quality and validation process, reducing the risk of other data issues like data drift for downstream channels.

That’s why this year, we’re trialling a small preview of a new format: PyCon Fair.

Each of our selected stalls will be provided with an A0-size poster on a pinboard, and a trestle table; the rest is up to their imagination.

PyCon Fair is pretty small this year; our hope is that it inspires you to come up with something cool to make it even bigger in future years! This year, we have two stalls that have been submitted as part of the Call for Proposals, plus an additional number of stalls that attendees can apply to be a part of during the conference.
