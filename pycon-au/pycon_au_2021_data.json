While these might seem to require special platforms and specialized expertise, in fact there's so much that can be done with graph-based technologies in Python. A team of open source developers has been working on [`kglab`](https://github.com/DerwenAI/kglab) to integrate many different libraries related to graph work into an abstraction that plays well with popular data science tools in Python: pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, Parquet, spaCy, PyTorch, RAPIDS, etc. This session will introduce _Graph Data Science_, showing how you can leverage these techniques into your data analytics work.\n\nhttps://pretalx.com/pycon-au-2021/talk/UTHCXW/\n\npython, pycon, australia, programming, conference, technical, pyconline, developers, panel, sessions, libraries, frameworks, community, sysadmins, students, education, data, science\n\nVideos licensed as CC-BY-NC-SA 4.0\r\n\r\nPyCon AU is the national conference for the Python programming community, bringing together professional, student and enthusiast developers, sysadmins and operations folk, students, educators, scientists, statisticians, and many others besides, all with a love for working with Python.\r\n\r\nPyCon AU informs the country’s Python developers with presentations, tutorials and panel sessions by experts and core developers of Python, as well as the libraries and frameworks that they rely on.\n\nProduced by Next Day Video Australia: https://nextdayvideo.com.au\n\nFri Sep 10 13:30:00 2021 at Science, Data & Analytics",

        "description": "(philnash) The humble password is broken. The internet is littered with poor security practices and password breaches, but the world is not ready to go password free yet. So what can we do to protect our users?\r\n\r\nLet's take a look at how we currently protect passwords, at what we can throw away from those processes and what we can bring in to help strengthen our users' passwords. We'll investigate the tools, practices and APIs that can help us in this endeavour. Together we can move the world from \"password1\" to \"correct horse battery staple\" and beyond!\n\nhttps://pretalx.com/pycon-au-2021/talk/3B8SEP/\n\npython, pycon, australia, programming, conference, technical, pyconline, developers, panel, sessions, libraries, frameworks, community, sysadmins, students, education, data, science\n\nVideos licensed as CC-BY-NC-SA 4.0\r\n\r\nPyCon AU is the national conference for the Python programming community, bringing together professional, student and enthusiast developers, sysadmins and operations folk, students, educators, scientists, statisticians, and many others besides, all with a love for working with Python.\r\n\r\nPyCon AU informs the country’s Python developers with presentations, tutorials and panel sessions by experts and core developers of Python, as well as the libraries and frameworks that they rely on.\n\nProduced by Next Day Video Australia: https://nextdayvideo.com.au\n\nFri Sep 10 15:00:00 2021 at Snakeoil Academy (Security & Privacy)",

Data is everywhere and it is super beneficial to leverage these data and build models for making sense out of them and telling stories. The field of sports, especially football (soccer), is enriched by data analysis that makes us understand the game better and predict outcomes. Many people want to delve deep into football (soccer) data analysis and get their hands dirty. This talk is to help them do so by pedagogically introducing them to the introductory analytical methodologies to overcome the initial barriers of the field and start working with data analyses and visualizations on football data to deduce interesting results.\n\nhttps://pretalx.com/pycon-au-2021/talk/PJWQZQ/\n\npython, pycon, australia, programming, conference, technical, pyconline, developers, panel, sessions, libraries, frameworks, community, sysadmins, students, education, data, science\n\nVideos licensed as CC-BY-NC-SA 4.0\r\n\r\nPyCon AU is the national conference for the Python programming community, bringing together professional, student and enthusiast developers, sysadmins and operations folk, students, educators, scientists, statisticians, and many others besides, all with a love for working with Python.\r\n\r\nPyCon AU informs the country’s Python developers with presentations, tutorials and panel sessions by experts and core developers of Python, as well as the libraries and frameworks that they rely on.\n\nProduced by Next Day Video Australia: https://nextdayvideo.com.au\n\nSun Sep 12 02:45:00 2021 at Backup Speakers",

Collett) Sources: https://github.com/lisushka/overlays\r\n\r\n'Add this one line of code to your website to avoid being sued!'\r\n\r\nIf you think that that statement sounds like a particularly obnoxious ad, or that it must be too good to be true, you're not alone.  However, over the past several years, a number of companies popped up with products which claimed to do just that.  Their solutions were marketed as a quick and easy way to satisfy legislative requirements, and best of all, ensure that your website would be accessible to anyone, anywhere.\r\n\r\nAnd then the lawsuits started.\r\n\r\nWelcome to the world of accessibility overlays. According to their creators, they're plug-and-play software which remediates accessibility issues on your website, bringing you into compliance with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines and disability access laws instantly.  However, if you ask the disabled people who should be reaping the benefits, the answer seems paradoxical: accessibility overlays actually make websites *less* usable for them.\r\n\r\nWhy is that?  And how did we get to a point where the most prominently advertised solutions for software accessibility make the problem worse?  Let's examine this cautionary tale, and find out what it can teach us about both accessibility and the principles of good design.\n\nhttps://pretalx.com/pycon-au-2021/talk/PFJFXW/\n\npython, pycon, australia, programming, conference, technical, pyconline, developers, panel, sessions, libraries, frameworks, community, sysadmins, students, education, data, science\n\nVideos licensed as CC-BY-NC-SA 4.0\r\n\r\nPyCon AU is the national conference for the Python programming community, bringing together professional, student and enthusiast developers, sysadmins and operations folk, students, educators, scientists, statisticians, and many others besides, all with a love for working with Python.\r\n\r\nPyCon AU informs the country’s Python developers with presentations, tutorials and panel sessions by experts and core developers of Python, as well as the libraries and frameworks that they rely on.\n\nProduced by Next Day Video Australia: https://nextdayvideo.com.au\n\nFri Sep 10 17:00:00 2021 at DevOops",

It was originally part of a workshop I delivered for new tutors in my University CS programs, with tips to help students learn programming more effectively both in one-on-one and group environments. It spans topics from psychology, to lesson design and to communication skills, and in the small and the large will help you communicate topics better.\n\nhttps://pretalx.com/pycon-au-2021/talk/87NDMH/\n\npython, pycon, australia, programming, conference, technical, pyconline, developers, panel, sessions, libraries, frameworks, community, sysadmins, students, education, data, science\n\nVideos licensed as CC-BY-NC-SA 4.0\r\n\r\nPyCon AU is the national conference for the Python programming community, bringing together professional, student and enthusiast developers, sysadmins and operations folk, students, educators, scientists, statisticians, and many others besides, all with a love for working with Python.\r\n\r\nPyCon AU informs the country’s Python developers with presentations, tutorials and panel sessions by experts and core developers of Python, as well as the libraries and frameworks that they rely on.\n\nProduced by Next Day Video Australia: https://nextdayvideo.com.au\n\nFri Sep 10 15:00:00 2021 at Education",

I was interested to hear more but skeptical that it could lure me away from the micro:bit lifestyle where I’d invested my time learning and developing content. But here I am, 6 months into my Kookaberry journey, and I’m a total convert. \r\n\r\nI’ll take you through my journey of discovery and show you how Kookaberry gives you an easier entry point to MicroPython and embedded systems for beginners, more extendable, realistic, and relatable project experiences for your existing programmers (without having to get the breadboards out!), and how you can utilise Kookaberry in a huge range of cross-curricular applications.\n\nhttps://pretalx.com/pycon-au-2021/talk/NXYTWM/\n\npython, pycon, australia, programming, conference, technical, pyconline, developers, panel, sessions, libraries, frameworks, community, sysadmins, students, education, data, science\n\nVideos licensed as CC-BY-NC-SA 4.0\r\n\r\nPyCon AU is the national conference for the Python programming community, bringing together professional, student and enthusiast developers, sysadmins and operations folk, students, educators, scientists, statisticians, and many others besides, all with a love for working with Python.\r\n\r\nPyCon AU informs the country’s Python developers with presentations, tutorials and panel sessions by experts and core developers of Python, as well as the libraries and frameworks that they rely on.\n\nProduced by Next Day Video Australia: https://nextdayvideo.com.au\n\nFri Sep 10 09:30:00 2021 at Education",
