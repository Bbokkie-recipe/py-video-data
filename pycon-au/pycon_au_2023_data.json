        "description": "(Jeremy Rotstein) You know it as the fuel gauge in your car, the blinking lights on your modem or the operational status page of your favourite cloud service. It's diagnostics! A data efficient technique for seeing how well your system is running in real time.\r\n\r\nWhat isn't so well known is that diagnostics can be embedded directly into your python application. Doing it this way provides a purely on-demand and human-readable interface of real-time system state and performance.\r\n\r\nCompared to a sequence of log messages, diagnostics are certainly more difficult to implement. After all, logging is essentially just some well-placed print statements, outputted to a file or third-party logging agent. \r\n\r\nBut this type of logging can be expensive, bandwidth intensive and hard to make sense of. Have you ever had to trawl through pages and pages of logs just to check your application is working well? \r\n\r\nIn this talk, you will learn a number of practical and pythonic techniques for serving custom diagnostics from within your application.\n\nhttps://pretalx.com/pyconau-2023/talk/MHKHKK/\n\npython, pycon, australia, programming, conference, technical, pyconline, developers, panel, sessions, libraries, frameworks, community, sysadmins, students, education, data, science\n\nVideos licensed as CC-BY-NC-SA 4.0\r\n\r\nPyCon AU is the national conference for the Python programming community, bringing together professional, student and enthusiast developers, sysadmins and operations folk, students, educators, scientists, statisticians, and many others besides, all with a love for working with Python.\n\nLicensed as CC BY-NC-SA - http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/\n\nProduced by Next Day Video Australia: https://nextdayvideo.com.au\n\nFri Aug 18 16:10:00 2023 at Hall A",

I'll walk through how the Pants build system works in practice for getting our code running in production, and how it's improved upon other common practices we previously used.\n\nhttps://pretalx.com/pyconau-2023/talk/RAKQDU/\n\npython, pycon, australia, programming, conference, technical, pyconline, developers, panel, sessions, libraries, frameworks, community, sysadmins, students, education, data, science\n\nVideos licensed as CC-BY-NC-SA 4.0\r\n\r\nPyCon AU is the national conference for the Python programming community, bringing together professional, student and enthusiast developers, sysadmins and operations folk, students, educators, scientists, statisticians, and many others besides, all with a love for working with Python.\n\nLicensed as CC BY-NC-SA - http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/\n\nProduced by Next Day Video Australia: https://nextdayvideo.com.au\n\nSat Aug 19 13:30:00 2023 at Hall A",

But what do you do after you integrated your ML models to your application? ‹u›How do you know that the output of the ML models are correct and up to standard? What are the signs that the model's performance is changing and how do you take action on such changes? ‹/u›\r\n\r\nTypically, these problems are just discussed on a theoretical and research level. But how can we carry over these techniques and apply it to our application? Not just that, how can we make it so that monitoring and performance check is as simple as writing a unit test (or not).\r\n\r\nIn this session, we will learn some simple but effective ways on model performance monitoring as well as look at some python implementation and architecture consideration.\n\nhttps://pretalx.com/pyconau-2023/talk/AXQPBA/\n\npython, pycon, australia, programming, conference, technical, pyconline, developers, panel, sessions, libraries, frameworks, community, sysadmins, students, education, data, science\n\nVideos licensed as CC-BY-NC-SA 4.0\r\n\r\nPyCon AU is the national conference for the Python programming community, bringing together professional, student and enthusiast developers, sysadmins and operations folk, students, educators, scientists, statisticians, and many others besides, all with a love for working with Python.\n\nLicensed as CC BY-NC-SA - http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/\n\nProduced by Next Day Video Australia: https://nextdayvideo.com.au\n\nFri Aug 18 16:50:00 2023 at Hall C (Plenary)",

        "description": "(Stephen Tierney, Alison Wong) Collaborative learning in the classroom has been shown to have a broad range of positive academic effects such as promotion of critical thinking, communication skills and improved learning outcomes. It also brings social and psychological benefits such as development of friendships, social support, reduced anxiety and increased appreciation for the course content.\r\n\r\nUnlike a traditional classroom, programming education tends to offer few opportunities for group activities as students tend to be restricted to their personal laptops  or to allocated workstations and are expected to learn in relative isolation. This is often due to environmental factors, such as it being hard to share a keyboard between more than two students at a time. Additionally, educators often design solo activities, because they are easy to implement and execute in the classroom. Since programming students aren’t trained to code with other people, they do not develop clear ideas on what good collaborations look like or how to collaborate with others successfully, which is an important skill in the workforce.\r\n\r\nPair programming is an oft cited solution, yet sharing workstations can be unsatisfying as one student is left in the backseat while the other drives. The situation is worsened for larger group sizes. Furthermore, there is no ability for a group of students to divide and conquer a problem as their attention and input must be the same as the driver.\r\n\r\nThis talk will introduce approaches to collaborative programming that extend beyond pair programming by allowing more than two students to collaborate in real-time on projects ranging from single Python scripts, to multi-file projects and Jupyter Notebooks. This has been accomplished across pairs, small groups, and even entire classrooms during both live classroom environments and for long-term group projects. We will also discuss the lessons we learnt along the way, as well as feedback from other educators and students.\n\nhttps://pretalx.com/pyconau-2023/talk/EPVD87/\n\npython, pycon, australia, programming, conference, technical, pyconline, developers, panel, sessions, libraries, frameworks, community, sysadmins, students, education, data, science\n\nVideos licensed as CC-BY-NC-SA 4.0\r\n\r\nPyCon AU is the national conference for the Python programming community, bringing together professional, student and enthusiast developers, sysadmins and operations folk, students, educators, scientists, statisticians, and many others besides, all with a love for working with Python.\n\nLicensed as CC BY-NC-SA - http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/\n\nProduced by Next Day Video Australia: https://nextdayvideo.com.au\n\nFri Aug 18 11:40:00 2023 at Hall B",

        "description": "(Stephen Tierney, Alison Wong) Programming education increasingly centres around tools that offer automatic marking of student progress through a set of exercises. Automated marking has become increasingly popular as it allows instructors to provide personalised feedback to students in real-time and is easily scalable to large cohorts. It can also be used to provide instructors with detailed insight into the class progression.\r\n\r\nWhile this brings many new advantages it also creates new problems. Chief amongst those is the difficulty of marking long, dynamic and interactive programs which places a large burden on educators to develop sophisticated marking systems.\r\n\r\nAt the more extreme end of the problem, we may be faced with students who want to take shortcuts such as hard-coding, or using Python’s built-in functionality and third party packages, which may violate the spirit of the exercise. As a result these students may not be achieving learning outcomes.\r\n\r\nIn this talk we will discuss and demonstrate practical approaches to the aforementioned problems that all educators can use to simplify marking and to increase their assurance of learning. We will also discuss current limitations that we face and provide recommendations to those wishing to apply these approaches.\n\nhttps://pretalx.com/pyconau-2023/talk/BQDYAD/\n\npython, pycon, australia, programming, conference, technical, pyconline, developers, panel, sessions, libraries, frameworks, community, sysadmins, students, education, data, science\n\nVideos licensed as CC-BY-NC-SA 4.0\r\n\r\nPyCon AU is the national conference for the Python programming community, bringing together professional, student and enthusiast developers, sysadmins and operations folk, students, educators, scientists, statisticians, and many others besides, all with a love for working with Python.\n\nLicensed as CC BY-NC-SA - http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/\n\nProduced by Next Day Video Australia: https://nextdayvideo.com.au\n\nFri Aug 18 14:30:00 2023 at Hall B",

These services can be scaled to millions of users. However, a myriad of problems comes hidden with it during the development phase if observability-driven development is not followed like the inability to meet the SLAs, poor performance, difficulty in tracking business metrics, etc and this can lead to anti-patterns in software.\r\n\r\nMetrics such as these can be valuable for root cause analysis, driving business goals, component-level monitoring, improving performance, and so on. In this presentation, I will discuss how to adhere to best practices for observability and reliability when building a Python service from the ground up. I will explain the meaning of each concept, how to establish a culture that promotes these practices and provide a detailed code walkthrough demonstrating how to implement these concepts effectively.\n\nhttps://pretalx.com/pyconau-2023/talk/SHMPRD/\n\npython, pycon, australia, programming, conference, technical, pyconline, developers, panel, sessions, libraries, frameworks, community, sysadmins, students, education, data, science\n\nVideos licensed as CC-BY-NC-SA 4.0\r\n\r\nPyCon AU is the national conference for the Python programming community, bringing together professional, student and enthusiast developers, sysadmins and operations folk, students, educators, scientists, statisticians, and many others besides, all with a love for working with Python.\n\nLicensed as CC BY-NC-SA - http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/\n\nProduced by Next Day Video Australia: https://nextdayvideo.com.au\n\nSun Aug 20 14:10:00 2023 at Hall C (Plenary)",

        "description": "(Jess Moore, Anushka Vidanage) Increasing awareness of personal data stored on centralised servers and individual need to access personal data in a connected world is driving the development of frameworks to support data sovereignty and privacy. The Australian National University’s Software Innovation Institute is collaborating with Gurriny Yealamucka Health Service (Gurriny) in the Yarrabah Indigenous community of North Queensland, Australia, to build privacy focused data infrastructure and associated software applications called the Solid Health System which will provide individuals with storage, ownership, and control over their own health data.  This model is using Social Linked Data (Solid) technology, a decentralised data storage specification for software application development, using open standards mostly developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Open source Solid server provides users with a secure online storage space called a personal online datastore (POD) to store their own data with granular control of data sharing using data access control policies to provision a trust-no-one environment. Cross-platform software applications are being developed with the Dart and Flutter framework to interact with PODS on a data pipeline built with Python.\n\nhttps://pretalx.com/pyconau-2023/talk/VUZFD9/\n\npython, pycon, australia, programming, conference, technical, pyconline, developers, panel, sessions, libraries, frameworks, community, sysadmins, students, education, data, science\n\nVideos licensed as CC-BY-NC-SA 4.0\r\n\r\nPyCon AU is the national conference for the Python programming community, bringing together professional, student and enthusiast developers, sysadmins and operations folk, students, educators, scientists, statisticians, and many others besides, all with a love for working with Python.\n\nLicensed as CC BY-NC-SA - http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/\n\nProduced by Next Day Video Australia: https://nextdayvideo.com.au\n\nFri Aug 18 10:00:00 2023 at Hall A",

        "description": "(Ram Balachandran) The United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 6, states access to safe drinking water and sanitation for all is a human right. Potable and sewer water networks are critical infrastructure to achieve this globally. In Australia, the annual industrial expenditure on potable and sewer water services is around 4.5 billion AUD. Managing and maintaining a calm water network is important from a consumer, environment and government perspective. Over the past few years, major water utilities across Australia have exponentially  added data collection through deployment of a wide range of IoT devices across the potable and sewer water networks. However, currently, this data is rarely used to effectively create insights to enable decision support that transforms productivity, reduces cost and minimises risk.\r\n\r\nAt Spiral Data, we focus on developing Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) tools towards creating these insights and decision support across the water industry. In this talk, we will discuss two important use cases that were designed, developed and deployed using our python base tech stack through our cloud partner (AWS).\r\n\r\n1. Identifying blockages in gravity sewer systems\r\nBlockages can happen especially in sewer networks and large blockages can have major environmental impact. However, detecting blockages is difficult since there are no current alarms or alerts. In this use case, we will discuss how we use AI/ML approaches to identify blockages in networks that can then raise an alert. This in turn can in turn enable support crew to address the blockage in a timely manner. These alerts can also enable operations teams to effectively plan around their limited budget and human capacity.\r\n\r\n2. Identifying high speed pressure changes in potable water network to monitor pipe failures\r\nPotable water networks, especially in large metro areas can experience recurrent large pressure changes (transients). This can be due to users (ex: fire testing) or it can be network induced (ex: valves/pump operation). These pressure transients can cause unexpected failures and as a result monitoring them is of pressing importance. However these data are collected at very high rates and as a result it cannot be analyzed at scale by humans. At SpiralData, we are building automated solutions using AI/ML to identify, analyze and group these high speed pressure transients. This in turn becomes a valuable tool to pursue field investigations to identify source and to also plan better for capex expenses.\n\nhttps://pretalx.com/pyconau-2023/talk/MAWUVE/\n\npython, pycon, australia, programming, conference, technical, pyconline, developers, panel, sessions, libraries, frameworks, community, sysadmins, students, education, data, science\n\nVideos licensed as CC-BY-NC-SA 4.0\r\n\r\nPyCon AU is the national conference for the Python programming community, bringing together professional, student and enthusiast developers, sysadmins and operations folk, students, educators, scientists, statisticians, and many others besides, all with a love for working with Python.\n\nLicensed as CC BY-NC-SA - http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/\n\nProduced by Next Day Video Australia: https://nextdayvideo.com.au\n\nFri Aug 18 16:50:00 2023 at Hall A",

And moving even further, there is the possibility of extending our work not only locally but also helping communities all around the globe.

First, it presents the importance of trusted data pipelines by testing data quality. It then discusses what we need to test data quality, from high levels (like tables, relations, …) to low levels (like rows and columns). After that, I will show how to implement these tests using different Dbt packages like dbt-utils and dbt-expectations.\r\n\r\nFinally, a demo with a complete ELT workflow will be presented. In this demo, Dagster is used as a data pipeline orchestrator, and Dbt is utilized for data transformation with its related testing packages. These transformed pipelines sit on top of Duckdb, which acts as a small data warehouse. This demo is published in a GitHub repository, allowing developers to clone and run the demo independently. \r\n\r\nThe talk will help data and analytics engineers build more robust tests for their data pipelines. These trusted data pipelines could enhance the data quality and validation process, reducing the risk of other data issues like data drift for downstream channels.\n\nhttps://pretalx.com/pyconau-2023/talk/RY9ZCY/\n\npython, pycon, australia, programming, conference, technical, pyconline, developers, panel, sessions, libraries, frameworks, community, sysadmins, students, education, data, science\n\nVideos licensed as CC-BY-NC-SA 4.0\r\n\r\nPyCon AU is the national conference for the Python programming community, bringing together professional, student and enthusiast developers, sysadmins and operations folk, students, educators, scientists, statisticians, and many others besides, all with a love for working with Python.\n\nLicensed as CC BY-NC-SA - http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/\n\nProduced by Next Day Video Australia: https://nextdayvideo.com.au\n\nFri Aug 18 15:30:00 2023 at Hall C (Plenary)",
