It departs from phrase-based statistical approaches that use separately engineered subcomponents. E.g. Google uses Google Neural Machine Translation (GNMT) in preference to its previous statistical methods. 



NMT has highly promising performance for large training data. The common principle is encoding the meaning of input into concept space and performing translation based on encoding which leads to deeper understanding and learning of translation rules, for better translation than SMT. 

The problem is the tendency towards overfitting to frequent observations and overlooking special cases. With the cause that the translational function is shared, so high- and low-frequency pairs impact each other by adapting shared parameters.

We will also show how we use existing 3D mesh python packages to adjust properties of the object for visualisation in screen and mixed reality platforms. The healthcare sector produces vast quantities of three dimensional images for the diagnosis and treatment of a large variety of medical conditions. 

Traditionally, the 3D images are reviewed by a highly qualified healthcare professional such as a radiologist or surgeon. As a result, the diagnosis and treatment of patient is time consuming, expensive and not scalable; moreover, this approach has limited efficacy as the medical doctor may not be able to obtain a general understanding of the anatomic three dimensional structure (e.g the shape and size of a tumor, the position of each bony fragment in a complex fracture, the location of an aneurysm together with surrounding vasculature, etc). 

The talk will focus on the advanced image processing techniques and Deep Learning approaches that are in active development developed both within academia and the private sector. These approaches aim to achieve a faster and better understanding of medical scans. They allow healthcare systems to provide a cheaper, faster and more effective medical service to patients.

Always wanted to publish a package on PyPI, but didn't know where to start? This talk is for you! Starting with nothing, we'll build a package and publish it on PyPI using current best practices. 

Publishing a package on PyPI used to be a cargo cult. (And often still is!) Instead of copying and pasting from other projects' `setup.py` without fully understanding what's happening, discover how to package your code for PyPI from scratch - then learn how to avoid doing any of this completely! (But now know you'll know what's going on).
 * _Why_ should you package your code for PyPI? * How to structure your project and your code, including why you need a `src` folder! 

* Discover what goes in your `Pipfile` and your `setup.py`, and why. Learn the difference between installing your library to use it, and installing it to develop on it. 

* Write tests for your project, and run them using Tox. 

* Ensure your code will work in different on different platforms with Continuous Integration! 

* Document your code so people won't ask you loads of questions! 

* How to actually get your code on PyPI using Twine. Configure your machine for PyPI and test your package release on the PyPI test server. 

* Finally, learn how avoid doing any of this yourself (or avoid doing it twice) using CookieCutter templates. By the end of this talk, you'll be so comfortable packaging projects you won't avoid writing `setup.py` files any more! Maybe you'll even start writing new code just so you can publish it on PyPI!",https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/eZef6bywIdo/maxresdefault.webp,0,False,False,public,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZef6bywIdo,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZef6bywIdo
