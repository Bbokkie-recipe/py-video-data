I'll discuss the complexities you run into when building ML products above normal software development. \n\nI'll give some techniques and strategies for overcoming these, and take the audience through the timeline of how Intercom built a successful ML product. (& we built it in Python, even though Intercom is normally all Ruby!)\n  \n\nTrack 1 Session 1,  Saturday",

Server side rendering of charts can work but often lead to a slower and poor user experience.\n\n\nThis talk proposes a solution by integrating a React frontend onto your Flask application, and taking advantage of the powerful and flexible React Victory library for data charting and visualisation.\n\n\nThis talk will cover the following topics:\nDiscussing the benefits of using a JS frontend.\nIntegrate a React frontend into your Flask app.\nInstalling and setting up the Webpack, Babel and Victory libraries.\nCreating an API endpoint to send JSON data.\nFetching API data from your React frontend.\nSome security concerns and how to resolve them.\nDisplaying chart data with Victory charts.\n\nHow to customize the charts.\n\n\nSession 4 Track 1 Saturday",

I will give a brief introduction to Webpack and how it is used in client-side web development. Webpack is a static module bundler that can be configured to take your static files (.js, .css, .vue, etc) and generate a minimised and optimised bundle for the web browser. \n\nI will then introduce a package called “django-webpack-loader” which can be used to seamlessly integrate Webpack into a Django application for both development purposes and deployment to the production site. This talk will introduce Webpack to Django developers to allow faster code development, improved debugging ability and better code performance. Using Webpack allows your Django project to soar!\"\n\n\n\n\nSession 7 Track 1 Saturday",

This year is going to be a little different. This year I'm going to use Python, Machine Learning, Google API and a Cloud Database to plan the vacation. It will be a driving holiday in Scotland, but what places do we visit and in what order? Using details of local landmarks and family personal interest, Python and machine learning are used to identify different groupings of local landmarks matching those interests. \n\nCombining the outputs of the Python Machine Learning a driving route will be planned to optimise the number of landmarks to visit, where to stay and what else to visit and then saving the details to a Cloud Database. Do one thing for me!  Don't tell my family this is how our vacation is being planned.\"\n  \nTrack 2, Session 6 Saturday",

        "description": "Message Queue for Distributed Computing on Kubernetes\n\n\nCertain projects require a large number of combinations to be evaluated to learn more about\nthe problem at hand. This could for example be a hyperparameter search, analyzing\n\nenormous sets of satellite images or simulations with different contexts. \n\nRunning these computations sequentially can be time consuming and these scenarios lend themselves well for parallelisation. One way of managing this type of distributed computing is using message queues. \n\nBy filling a queue with the work that needs to be done, workers can run next to each\n\nother and continuously request new tasks. \n\nThe message queue makes sure that every task\nis done exactly once, while it can also be used to store the results of each task again. In this\ntalk I will showcase a system that performs distributed hyperparameter search by running a\nRedis queue together with a number of worker pods on Kubernetes. I will go over the\nnecessary configuration, the queue filling task and the design of the worker processes. The\naim of this talk is to show one of the approaches of distributed computing and to teach how\nto implement a system like this in Kubernetes.\n\nDescription:\nDoing a large amount of computation distributed instead of sequentially can be very\nbeneficial. One way to achieve this is by using message queues. Hyperparameter search is\na good candidate for applying this concept. In this talk I will showcase a system that\nperforms distributed hyperparameter search by running a Redis queue together with a\nnumber of worker pods on Kubernetes.\n\n\nTrack 2, Session 8 Saturday",

        "description": "\"Push Over Pandas\"\n\npandas  has been the default library of choice for data analysis / manipulation in the Python ML ecosystem.\n\nRecently there has a raft of new libraries/frameworks that are similar in design intent as pandas (easy & fast analysis and manipulation of mixed data types in a tabular structure) but take different implementation pathways, incorporating newer compute paradigms. Some of these include\n- Dask:  allowing you to scale from single computer to run on 1000+ clusters of machines using familiar pandas APIs.\n- data.table:  from h20.ai focusing on single machines, that can process moderately large amounts of data (100GB) - taking advantage of column-orientated data storage and native-c implementation of all datatypes (including strings unlike pandas)\n- modin: from the RiseLab, Berkely:  taking advantage of ray to seamlessly speed up existing pandas based notebooks, scripts, and libraries.\n- vaex: a python library for lazy out-of-core data-frames that can calculate statistics on an N-dimensional grid for more than a billion (10^9) objects/rows per second and has incredibly fast and memory efficient support for all common string manipulations.\n- rapids from Nivida:  a suite of software libraries, built on CUDA-X AI, allowing you build ML pipelines entirely on GPUs.\n\nIn this talk myself and my colleague Barry will give an overview of some of emerging data-frame technologies and guide the listener to advantages, pitfalls and also considerations as to where some of these new libraries may be worthwhile considering as part of the ML practitioners toolkit.\n\n\nTrack 2, Session 7 Sunday",

        "description": "This talk will look at how the Irish Film Institute began to create python scripts in order to facilitate the preservation of our digital objects. This largely stemmed from bad experiences with vendors providing proprietary GUIs, which led to me learning python my spare time and building a suite of tools that handle things like integrity checks, archival packaging, metadata extraction and transformation, auditing, file format normalisation and migration, the generation of access copies, and adhering to international standards\n\nIt also will show how I ended up carving out a role and made python and open source tools an integral part of how we work in the Irish Film Institute - something that would have seemed impossible just a few years ago.\n\nWe recently won an award from the Digital Preservation Coalition for these scripts, beating the White House and Uk national parliament archives in the process. https://github.com/kieranjol/IFIscripts\n\nThe talk will focus on the approach we take to writing and using the scripts, as well as how we ended up adopting such a different approach - when a lot of memory instituions reach out for large, monolithic proprietary systems rather than bespoke microservices.\n\nHopefully it will show that an 'amateur', self-taught developer can use python in a cultural institution for a huge variety of uses, as well as highlighting the flaws in the project the and deviations from best practise (lack of OOP and unittesting in particular)\"\n \n\n\nTrack 3 Saturday, Session 7",

We had idea to reduce the time to find most useful Youtube video, and increase user confidence in right choice. For this purpose we build NLP pipeline in python, using 5 microservices deployed in multi-cloud environment (IBM PaaS, Google IaaS). \n\n\n\nCore of the project is advanced sorting algorithm based per similarity with books, e.g how similar is python video with most ranked Safari books. Second part is sorting youtube video comments based on sentiment, and third part automatically generating table of content based per video transcript.\n\n\nPython is used for backend, to extract text from youtube video, process the text, and NLP machine learning part. All microservices on backend side use Python Flask, and our DB of choice is MongoDB. \n\n\n\nMy role was project management, architecture and development.\nPresentation will show advanced usage of Python and hardware like GPU for NLP in novel idea to visualise context on Youtube video.\n\n\n\nWebsite can be tested here: https://yousight.eu-gb.mybluemix.net/\n\n\nTrack 3 Sunday, Session 4",
