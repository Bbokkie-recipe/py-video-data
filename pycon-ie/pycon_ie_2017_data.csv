Paired with a high-level protocol such as Socket.IO, you get a powerful and easy to use framework for bi-directional, low latency communication, with clients available for Python, JavaScript, Java, iOS, Android, C++, .Net and more. Flask is a lightweight and very popular web framework for Python that makes writing web servers easy and fun, without sacrificing any power. What happens when you combine WebSocket, Socket.IO and Flask? In this talk I'm going to show you some of the cool applications that you can build when these technologies are put to work together, including streaming audio and video, real-time sensor data, automatic voting and more!

They each have their own specific features but in the end they are all very similar in their core functionality of processing requests and generating responses. In this talk I will discuss why I felt the need to create yet another framework, a pico framework, that specifically focuses on the task of building HTTP based APIs for the web. Pico, as it is aptly called, doesn't do templating, ORM, custom routing, authentication, validation, caching, or a million other things. Instead it helps you write clean APIs using simple functions and modules with minimal boilerplate. Pico is both opinionated and flexible in equal measures so you can focus on what matters; your API logic. Pico helps you to write code that that is simple to get started, trivial to test, and easy to maintain as your project grows. APIs built with Pico are self describing so client code can automatically/dynamically be created. Pico includes both a Python & Javascript client but it is also very simple to interact with your API with plain old cURL/Requests/jQuery/etc. It is just a HTTP API after all. 

Having recently released Pico 2.0, this talk will outline the evolution of this framework over the past 7 years and discuss some lessons learnt along the way about building HTTP APIs and frameworks.

I'll present Áireamhán, a small Lisp-like language that I built (in Python of course), that is, as far as I know, the first and only programming language *as Gaeilge*. I'll cover some of the core ideas in language design; lexing, parsing, tokenization, with an emphasis on how you can compactly implement these in Python to build your own language. I'll also discuss the features of Lisp (and Áireamhán), and how these functional programming primitives give us a really powerful framework for computation that inspired some of the parts of Python that we all know and love.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/0r8eIU_aJsY/maxresdefault.webp,0,False,False,public,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r8eIU_aJsY,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r8eIU_aJsY

The idea is to use time series prediction models to predict the past after certain intervention date (our marketing action) and compare what would have happened to what actually happened. With some basic black magic trickery (statistics) we can then draw conclusions about effectiveness of the marketing intervention. This basic talk would cover using simple off the shelf tools (fbprophet) and ML techniques.,https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HjMpQXabvqw/maxresdefault.webp,0,False,False,public,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjMpQXabvqw,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjMpQXabvqw

A variety of mathematical tools is available to model simple processes analytically, However, when things get more complicated we need to fall back on to Monte Carlo simulations. 



SimPy is a package that uses generators to model discrete, time-based processes, such as queueing systems, financial markets and network protocols. By simulating a process or scenario a significant number of times, we can inspect possibilities of failure, expected utilization rates, targets aimed for in the healthcare industry and how changes we make in the decisions for our processes impact these performance indicators. In the talk, we use the running example of alien UFO factories, where we assume the role of factory manager and need to make decisions on hiring staff, the equipment that we need in our processing pipeline, the contracts with our customers and the actual location of our new factory. 



Some choices cost less money but are less efficient or introduce higher risks, and dependencies between the different parts of the process make it difficult to oversee the impact of our choices. After showcasing the scenario, we will add these concepts one by one in our SimPy model and link them to discrete event simulation theory. After the implementation, we can gather insights on the risks and the profits and make an informed decision on our factory. This talk is aimed at people interested in Monte Carlo simulation, stochastic optimization, Operations Research, statistics, UFOs or an innovative way of using Python generators.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Ss13QdNU1vY/maxresdefault.webp,0,False,False,public,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss13QdNU1vY,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss13QdNU1vY

An important property of these vector is being able to capture semantic relationships, for example: Ireland - Dublin + London = ??? These techniques have been driving important improvements in many NLP applications over the past few years, so the interest around word embeddings is spreading. 



In this talk, we'll discuss the basic linguistic intuitions behind word embeddings, we'll compare some of the most popular word embedding approaches, from word2vec to fastText, and we'll showcase their use with Python libraries. The aim of the talk is to be approachable for beginners, so the theory is kept to a minimum. By attending this talk, you'll be able to learn: 

- the core features of word embeddings 

- how to choose between different word embedding algorithms 

- how to implement word embedding techniques in Python",https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/GlKjHjPqUnE/maxresdefault.webp,0,False,False,public,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlKjHjPqUnE,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlKjHjPqUnE
