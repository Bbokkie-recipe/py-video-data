Have you ever found yourself writing complex code only to discover that Python has tools available within its library that could have made your job easier? Then this talk is for you!\n\nThe outline of the talk:\n* Basic information about the library\n* Well-known modules which do less-known things\n* `functools` less-known features: `@singledispatch`, `partial()`, `@cache`\n* `itertools` less-known features: `product()`, `filterfalse()`, `zip_longest()`\n* `collections` less-known features: `ChainMap`, `defaultdict`\n* Less-known modules which do well-known things\n* `doctest` for testing: `testmod()`\n* `Difflib` & `Filecmp` for comparison: `Difflib.SequenceMatcher`, `Filecmp.cmpfiles()`\n* `contextlib` for tasks involving the `with` statement: `@contextmanager`, `@asynccontextmanager`\n\nBy attending this session, you'll gain a deeper understanding of Python's standard library and you'll discover the \"unknown unknowns\" - tools that you may not even know exist within Python's standard library. By becoming familiar with the library and all of its capabilities, you'll be better equipped to solve problems and build applications more efficiently, without reinventing the wheel. You'll also receive recommendations on where to find additional resources and information so you can continue learning and exploring Python's tools after the conference has ended.\n\nGROUND FLOOR ROOM 1 Sat 3:40 pm - 4:15 pm",

        "description": "Using Static Analysis to Elevate Your Python Code: \nStatic Analysis is a software testing method that checks your code for maintainability issues and security vulnerabilities without needing to execute your code. While Static Analysis tools have existed for some time, modern tools have adapted to better integrate with developers’ workflows. The goal is to help developers write higher quality, more secure code without disrupting their day-to-day workflows.\n\nSince the advent of agile software development, a heavy emphasis has always been placed on delivery speed and quick iteration in order to maximize the new value being provided to end users through new features. However, going too fast can mean taking shortcuts that, in the best case, makes your code messy and difficult to understand, or in the worst case can open your organization to security risks.\n\nThus, Static Analysis is a critical tool to add to your organization’s workflow to minimize these issues without taking a major hit to developer productivity.\n\nIn this talk, we’ll cover:\n- The importance of shifting left and catching issues earlier to save developers time later in the software development life cycle\n- Overview of common issues and security vulnerabilities that can easily go missed in Python code (with examples)\n- What Static Analysis and Software Composition Analysis are, and how they help you shift left when looking for issues\n- How modern Static Analysis tools integrate with common developer tools (IDEs, Git Repos, CI) to be less disruptive while maintaining their impact",

Do you have friends trying to learn as an adult? Are you an adult career-switcher?\n\nWith so many resources for people getting started in programming, the options can be overwhelming. People often are left to wonder how and when to get started or what they can do to yield better outcomes. This talk will be a two-part discussion: first, on teaching children and second, on supporting adult career-switchers. For children, we will focus on fun and engaging ways to help them get started with coding in Python, how to decide if they are ready, and what can be helpful to do before that time comes. For Adults, we will discuss available resources, ideal learning plans, and realistic goals/outcomes. Emphasis will be placed on getting started, getting out of \"tutorial purgatory\" and getting into real, portfolio building, projects. For members of the Python community, we will be talking about getting involved through impactful mentorship.",

        "description": "In 2018, sick of my banking job, I took on a small gig to rewrite financial algorithms in a parallel Python library called Numba for GPU. Only problem was that I didn’t know anything about parallel processing or Python or own a GPU. But I took the job anyway, figuring how hard could it be? It turned out to be very hard. Even getting a server with GPU up and running on AWS (which I also had never used) took days. But I enjoyed the project and managed to complete it. \nFast-forward 5 years and Last Mile has grown to a team of for software engineer/analysts. And we’ve carried out projects as diverse as supply chain forecasting, predictive maintenance for mines, K12 CS education strategy for Microsoft and my favourite, the optimization of chocolate manufacturing. We also tried our hand at launching our own product. Along the way we have not only learned Python the hard way. We have also had to come to grips with deploying PyTorch transformer models, creating complex micro-services, handling data streaming at scale and a host of other challenges. I’d like to share our journey with you and reflect on how to (or how not to!) free-lance as a software or AI consultant, start a Python based business, grow a company and handle complex projects in specialisms that you could never train for.\n\nGround Floor Room 2 Sat 11:10 am - 11:45 am",

However, after years of ongoing efforts, the community has achieved a breakthrough with the acceptance of PEP 703.\n\nThis talk will delve into the GIL, its origins, and the reasons for its removal. It will provide a brief introduction to the GIL and its significance in Python's early days.\n\nWe'll also explore the journey of various attempts to remove the GIL, including the gilectomy by Larry Hastings, and understand the obstacles faced during those attempts.\n\nThe focus will then shift to the success story behind PEP 703, highlighting Sam Gross's remarkable 'nogil' project, which played a crucial role in getting the proposal accepted.\n\nFinally, we'll touch on the roadmap proposed by the CPython core development team for merging PEP 703, offering insights into what we can expect in the future of Python's multithreading capabilities.\n\nGROUND FLOOR ROOM 1 Sat 11:45 am - 12:20 pm",

To make your life even harder, some events might only be seen during certain failure scenarios, making it difficult to write robust code.\n\nIn this talk I'll show:\n- How to write basic code to listen to events\n- An example of some events you might see in typical S3 requests\n- How to use mitmproxy to intercept, understand and ultimately rewrite HTTP requests between boto3 and AWS to simulate different scenarios\n- An example of the events you'll see during request retries\n- An example putting this together to insert monitoring into the boto3 retry mechanism to diagnose network issues\n\nGROUND FLOOR ROOM 1 Sat 10:35 am - 11:10 am",

However, the process of building, training, and deploying machine learning models at scale can be a complex task. This talk will focus on how Python, as a leading programming language in the AI field, can interact with AWS SageMaker to streamline this process and make scalable AI deployment achievable.\n\nDuring this session, I will take the audience on a journey through the world of AWS SageMaker, an integrated platform designed to assist developers and data scientists to build, train, and deploy machine learning models. I will focus on how Python can be utilised to maximise the benefits of SageMaker, demonstrating its use through real-world examples.\n\nIn this presentation, I will cover:\n\nIntroduction to AWS SageMaker: Understand the fundamental features of SageMaker and why it is a potent tool for AI and ML development.\n\nPython & SageMaker: Dive into the synergies between Python and SageMaker. Learn how to write Python scripts that harness the power of SageMaker for model training, evaluation, and deployment.\n\nReal-world Case Studies: Walk through a series of real-world use cases that illustrate the successful application of SageMaker in Python-based AI projects.\n\nBest Practices and Pitfalls: Gain insights into the best practices when using Python with SageMaker, and learn about common challenges and how to overcome them.\n\nFuture of AI with Python and SageMaker: Discussion around the potential advancements and improvements we can anticipate in the AI world, with Python and AWS SageMaker at its core.\n\nGround Floor Room 2 Sat 10:35 am - 11:10 am",
