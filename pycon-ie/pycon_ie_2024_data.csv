But you know what’s even more fun? Talking about the failures! In fact this one should be more fun for you than me.
As Peter Thiel wisely noted, most failures are over-determined, so it’s tough to pinpoint the main culprit. Still, some patterns do emerge. And yes, I may have been involved in a few... on *rare* occasions.

Since this is a Python conference, we’ll focus on technical blunders—design, implementation, the whole mess. But we’ll touch on business mistakes too because… IT’S ALL CONNECTED!

Here are the ""highlights""—or should I say, lowlights:
- Why deploying even moderately large AI models is a nightmare (spoiler: they're total drama queens).
- How machine learning performance never quite translates into production (and no, more representative data isn’t always the magic fix despite what the textbooks say).
- How premature abstraction—like an overuse of metaclasses—can wreck your dev cadence faster than spilling coffee on your keyboard.
- How serverless moves logic from code to infra, where there are no safety nets (debugging in the cloud? Digital haystack. Needle? Gone.).
- Why frontend dev seems easy to us Python folks but absolutely isn’t (spoiler: users!).
- How DevOps can swallow 50% of your dev budget if you blink. Cloud? It’s already taken the other 50%.
- How algorithmic thinking beats yet another framework.
- How Agile theatre kills your cadence faster than a daily stand-up.
- And more, if your stomach can handle it! (Sorry, antacids not provided.)

But we won’t just dwell on the pain. We'll also dive into solutions—like the ones that make things worse (hint: more microservices!) and the ones that actually work (hint: meet CDK, your new best friend).

We will demonstrate using an example use-case and use open source tools such as ChromaDB vector database, the LangChain package and popular industry LLM providers such as OpenAI. Attendees will gain insights into cutting-edge practices such as Context Enrichment Techniques, Intelligent Reranking, Dynamic Chunk Sizing, Semantic Chunking, Explainable Retrieval, Ensemble Retrieval, and Knowledge Graph Integration.

Learning Objectives:
- Understand advanced techniques to improve RAG applications
- Learn practical implementation strategies for each technique
- Gain insights into the benefits and challenges of these methods

Target Audience: This talk is aimed at developers, data scientists, and researchers with a background in Python who are looking to dive deeper into the world of RAGs and LLMs for common use cases.

Description:
With the rapid adoption of LLMs across industries, the RAG framework has emerged as a powerful tool for building applications like customer support chatbots, virtual assistants, and search engines. By augmenting LLMs with external knowledge, RAG can significantly enhance performance and accuracy. However, developing a robust, reliable, and secure RAG application is challenging due to hurdles like unmet requirements, subpar performance, and cost constraints. This talk will equip you with the essential skills to build a RAG application you can be proud of.
We'll delve into various aspects of the RAG application lifecycle to optimize performance and reliability. From dynamically and semantically splitting long documents into smaller chunks to employing intelligent reranking and multi-source document retrieval, we'll explore practical techniques to improve search efficiency. To enhance user trust and understanding, we'll incorporate explainable AI methods. Finally, we'll demonstrate how to enrich prompt context with external information and knowledge graphs for more comprehensive and informative responses.

It's simple, easy to understand, and automatic.

Is your code the same? How would you start to make sure it is? Let’s dive into those questions in this talk.

First off, the basics: security is based on trust, but trust must be verified. This is especially true in the design of 'zero-trust' networks. Knowing who your code trusts, and how you verify that trust, is therefore essential.

This talk will briefly go through some of the basics, such public/private key cryptography, DNS, and x509 certificate signing, before examining some of the wider implementation and regulation of PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) online. We'll look at how python interfaces with this, along with some history, and look towards the future of important integrations like certifi and truststore.

We'll then look at the problems of Supply Chain Attacks and ask how much you should trust your dependencies, before looking at some of the other basic services your code relies on like DNS.

We’ll then see how you can leverage these trust mechanisms to your advantage to make your code as secure as possible, especially when working in your own cloud environment.

Hopefully, this talk will give you a headstart or a refresh on the knowledge required to have genuinely constructive paranoia when coding.

Failing that, at the very least, I promise to make you the go-to expert on how your company's VPN and proxy cause headaches in python and how to fix them securely, rather than giving up and setting a ""trusted-host"".

Is there anything worse than Lovecraft's creatures, worse than Cthulhu or the Shoggoths? No, it's not a forgotten bug; it's much worse: inefficient legacy code! Not only does maintaining it terrify us, but it also requires more and more resources to function and worsens our carbon footprint! What if AI could come to the rescue?

It is well known that some programming languages are much more energy-intensive than others. For example, Python is about 76 times more energy-intensive than Rust or C. So, how can AI help us convert an old legacy project into a less energy-intensive technology?

We will explore the environmental impact of legacy code and how AI can be used to optimize this code. We will examine concrete cases where AI can automatically convert inefficient code into optimized code. And of course, this must be done without regression and without compromising maintainability.

Maybe for a small piece of code, but what about a large project? Let's discover autonomous AI agents, they will work together to help us!

We will also conduct a practical demonstration of converting legacy Python code to Rust, showing the gains in energy efficiency and reductions in CO2 emissions.

Room 2 Session 11
Uncertainty estimation is a game-changer in banking, trading, retail, and many other fields. The potential applications are endless, and new innovations are emerging across all sectors.

Two great examples of uncertainty estimation models are:

- Financial risk models, which have been helping banks and trading firms navigate market volatility for years, preventing potential bankruptcies.

- Demand forecasting models, which give valuable insights that allow companies to make better decisions, boosting their efficiency.

The best way to understand uncertainty estimation models is by seeing them in action. That’s why in this talk we will walk through some real-world risk estimation examples using Python. We’ll explore the pros and cons of various stochastic and machine learning models currently employed by leading companies.

While there is no one-size-fits-all model for quantifying uncertainty, this conference will provide you with useful information to choose the best model for your specific use case.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0YeadT_BAU4/maxresdefault.jpg,0,False,False,unlisted,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YeadT_BAU4,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YeadT_BAU4

Ever since I discovered that there are e-ink displays that you can attach to a Raspberry Pi and program with Python, my mind went racing. You could make anything and hang it on the wall.

What can you do with them? Sure, you can photo stand with them. Or show a joke of the day. But there's so much more.

And so I build a dashboard that shows my cycling statistics. And a display that shows my calendar for the upcoming days, so I don't forget my appointments. And I created a donation tracker that I used in the field during sponsoring events.

For the future I hope to see bigger and bigger e-ink displays that can replace posters.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ulSu7QKkCrg/maxresdefault.jpg,0,False,False,unlisted,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ulSu7QKkCrg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ulSu7QKkCrg

The ""data build tool"" (DBT) was designed to unlock software engineering best practices for SQL-based data pipelines: pipelines as version controlled directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) consisting of testable and reusable nodes. With the increasing number of cloud data warehouses and data lakehouses that allow the native execution of Python code, DBT also added support for Python models.
In this talk, I will explain how Flatiron Health uses DBT to improve and extend lives by learning from the experience of every person with cancer. We will discuss an example project setup that uses SQL as well as Python models. I will share our experiences with unit and data testing as well as with writing a reusable variable library.
The talk is well-suited for anyone with prior data warehouse or data lakehouse experience who is curious how they can leverage DBT to write test-driven and reusable data piplines.

There is more to causal inference in industry than A/B testing. Often you will want to assess process change where a control group split is wasteful or unethical. To accommodate these questions we can use quasi-experimental causal inference techniques of the kind implemented in CausalPy. CausalPy ensures that we incorporate uncertainty in the estimates of causal effects using Bayesian methods built on top of PyMC.

We will survey some recent additions to the package and highlight the centrality and use of causal inference in solving business problems.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-C4p4b2cUp8/maxresdefault.jpg,0,False,False,unlisted,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-C4p4b2cUp8,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-C4p4b2cUp8
