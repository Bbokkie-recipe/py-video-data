Destiny-Focus is an app for Destiny the game, helping you focus on improving particular aspects of your playstyle, for casual or competitive PvP, PvE, or Raiding game modes.
To achieve this, Destiny-Focus allows you to choose an area you want to focus on improving, such as your PvP Kill / Death Ratio (K/D R) or your accuracy with a particular weapon type, such as tracking headshots with your favourite sniper.
Destiny-Focus pulls data from your last (30-200) games, analyses the data, and gives users actionable feedback, or focus goals, to help improve their gamestyle.
Players are also able to search for their friends or favourite streamers accounts, and view their game stats and focus goals.

Destiny-Focus is built with a Flask backend and a frontend designed in ReactJS and TypeScript.
The Flask app is used for user authentication, storing links to liked activities, storing the game ""Manifest"" details of in game assets - such as weapons and armour.
Users can also like and share their favourite games with their friends. Liked games are stored in a PostgreSQL database and a GUI was designed to help playuers navigate and share their favourite games.
The app builds a sharable link where the ""Post Game Carnage Report"" can be shared with friends, without authorization, even if they don't have Destiny accounts.

Notes and comments

We take a tour into everything that happens on on a “def” line in Python, and explore how to make the most of all the rich metadata provided about functions, before going into detail hacking the Python decorator pattern.

Abstract
Functions are fundamental to python, and are amongst the first features of python that most users learn. We call a function with arguments, and it returns a value. However, there is more to this callable interface than meets the eye, and there are lots of useful and powerful things we can do with the callable interface. You may have come across many of these already: (anonymous) lambda functions, the call magic method, the decorator pattern, the doc property, and modules like functools and inspect which provide detailed about functions and allow us to alter functions at runtime. The now-retired Python 3.6 release added typing annotations to this mix, and opened up a new world of metadata to use alongside your callables.

Lots of libraries, particularly web frameworks like Flask, Django, and FastAPI, and testing toolkits like pytest, use this callable interface to implement their API. As developers, understanding these advanced features of python’s callable interface is particularly useful when writing generic, automation focused code, and understanding how such prominent libraries work.

This talk gives a deep-dive into python functions, and the associated callable interface. We’ll start with a quick tour of the basics, before covering python’s more advanced callable features, and exploring some examples about how, why, and when you may wish to use these features yourself.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pzV-J1B6qJ8/maxresdefault.jpg,0,False,False,public,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzV-J1B6qJ8,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzV-J1B6qJ8

Destiny-Focus is an app for Destiny the game, helping you focus on improving particular aspects of your playstyle, for casual or competitive PvP, PvE, or Raiding game modes.
To achieve this, Destiny-Focus allows you to choose an area you want to focus on improving, such as your PvP Kill / Death Ratio (K/D R) or your accuracy with a particular weapon type, such as tracking headshots with your favourite sniper.
Destiny-Focus pulls data from your last (30-200) games, analyses the data, and gives users actionable feedback, or focus goals, to help improve their gamestyle.
Players are also able to search for their friends or favourite streamers accounts, and view their game stats and focus goals.

Destiny-Focus is built with a Flask backend and a frontend designed in ReactJS and TypeScript.
The Flask app is used for user authentication, storing links to liked activities, storing the game ""Manifest"" details of in game assets - such as weapons and armour.
Users can also like and share their favourite games with their friends. Liked games are stored in a PostgreSQL database and a GUI was designed to help playuers navigate and share their favourite games.
The app builds a sharable link where the ""Post Game Carnage Report"" can be shared with friends, without authorization, even if they don't have Destiny accounts.

Notes and comments

Abstract
Functions are fundamental to python, and are amongst the first features of python that most users learn. We call a function with arguments, and it returns a value. However, there is more to this callable interface than meets the eye, and there are lots of useful and powerful things we can do with the callable interface. You may have come across many of these already: (anonymous) lambda functions, the call magic method, the decorator pattern, the doc property, and modules like functools and inspect which provide detailed about functions and allow us to alter functions at runtime. The now-retired Python 3.6 release added typing annotations to this mix, and opened up a new world of metadata to use alongside your callables.

Lots of libraries, particularly web frameworks like Flask, Django, and FastAPI, and testing toolkits like pytest, use this callable interface to implement their API. As developers, understanding these advanced features of python’s callable interface is particularly useful when writing generic, automation focused code, and understanding how such prominent libraries work.

This talk gives a deep-dive into python functions, and the associated callable interface. We’ll start with a quick tour of the basics, before covering python’s more advanced callable features, and exploring some examples about how, why, and when you may wish to use these features yourself.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pzV-J1B6qJ8/maxresdefault.jpg,0,False,False,public,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzV-J1B6qJ8,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzV-J1B6qJ8

It is built on top of knowledge discovery techniques enabling users to explore COVID-19 concepts easily.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rSkyIu7Av_k/maxresdefault.jpg,0,False,False,public,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSkyIu7Av_k,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSkyIu7Av_k

Python is a widely-used programming language thanks to its simple code syntax, but this convenience is brought by the hard work of the compiler. Among the many implementations (like PyPy and JPython), we will look at the most widely used CPython implementation. 
The talk will look at the compilation steps, and examine how the resulting bytecode will be executed in the Python virtual machine. Before a simple string is displayed on a terminal, CPython processes code performs complicated tasks from lexical analysis, parsing, compilation, and to evaluation loop. Even executing a simple program like print(“Hello world”) requires this laborious process performed instantly on the computer. 
By understanding the execution pipeline, we can identify execution bottlenecks to improve code performance.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/u6XDRzLX6Eo/maxresdefault.jpg,0,False,False,public,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6XDRzLX6Eo,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6XDRzLX6Eo

At its core a feature store needs to provide reliable features to data scientists to build and productionize models. So how can we avoid garbage in, garbage out situations? Great expectations is the most popular library for data validation, and so the two are a natural fit. In this talk we will cover the core concepts of Great Expectations and how you can leverage them in a feature store.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wj5ni1EH02I/maxresdefault.jpg,0,False,False,public,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj5ni1EH02I,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj5ni1EH02I
