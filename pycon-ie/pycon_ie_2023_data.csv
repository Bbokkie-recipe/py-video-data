Static Analysis is a software testing method that checks your code for maintainability issues and security vulnerabilities without needing to execute your code. While Static Analysis tools have existed for some time, modern tools have adapted to better integrate with developers’ workflows. The goal is to help developers write higher quality, more secure code without disrupting their day-to-day workflows.

Since the advent of agile software development, a heavy emphasis has always been placed on delivery speed and quick iteration in order to maximize the new value being provided to end users through new features. However, going too fast can mean taking shortcuts that, in the best case, makes your code messy and difficult to understand, or in the worst case can open your organization to security risks.

Thus, Static Analysis is a critical tool to add to your organization’s workflow to minimize these issues without taking a major hit to developer productivity.

In this talk, we’ll cover:
- The importance of shifting left and catching issues earlier to save developers time later in the software development life cycle
- Overview of common issues and security vulnerabilities that can easily go missed in Python code (with examples)
- What Static Analysis and Software Composition Analysis are, and how they help you shift left when looking for issues

Only problem was that I didn’t know anything about parallel processing or Python or own a GPU. But I took the job anyway, figuring how hard could it be? It turned out to be very hard. Even getting a server with GPU up and running on AWS (which I also had never used) took days. But I enjoyed the project and managed to complete it. 
Fast-forward 5 years and Last Mile has grown to a team of for software engineer/analysts. And we’ve carried out projects as diverse as supply chain forecasting, predictive maintenance for mines, K12 CS education strategy for Microsoft and my favourite, the optimization of chocolate manufacturing. We also tried our hand at launching our own product. Along the way we have not only learned Python the hard way. We have also had to come to grips with deploying PyTorch transformer models, creating complex micro-services, handling data streaming at scale and a host of other challenges.

Descriptors are one of those things that many don't even bother to learn because they look confusing.

Thankfully for you, I figured out how descriptors work 20 minutes ago, so there is no one better prepared to teach you descriptors than someone who _just_ learned how they work.

In this talk I will provide an example that shows how descriptors work and that will also motivate why they are useful and needed.

By the time we are done, you will be able to implement descriptors in your code, use them for practical purposes and, most importantly, you will be able to deliver a talk just like mine!

The talk will be easier to follow if you are familiar with how properties work (via the `@property` decorator).

# Outline

The outline of the talk is as follows:
- using properties to implement getters for private attributes or attributes that are computed on the fly;
- using properties to implement setters for those same attributes;
- defining a bunch of similar properties;
- using descriptors to abstract away the pattern that the properties follow;
- descriptor `__get__`;
- descriptor `__set__`; and
- descriptor `__set_name__`.

The talk will start by going over the basics of properties, but it is does not provide a comprehensive introduction to Python properties.

boto3 isn't easily extended via inheritance or callbacks, instead it offers an event system which allows you to intercept and modify calls at different stages in their lifecycle.

This is a very powerful mechanism which can be quite hard to start using due to the documentation only covering a subset of events. To make your life even harder, some events might only be seen during certain failure scenarios, making it difficult to write robust code.

In this talk I'll show:
- How to write basic code to listen to events
- An example of some events you might see in typical S3 requests
- How to use mitmproxy to intercept, understand and ultimately rewrite HTTP requests between boto3 and AWS to simulate different scenarios
