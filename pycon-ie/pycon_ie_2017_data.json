        "description": "WebSocket enables a web server to establish dedicated connections with clients, on which raw data can flow at any time and in any direction, free of the request/response cycle and the \"chattiness\" of the HTTP protocol. Paired with a high-level protocol such as Socket.IO, you get a powerful and easy to use framework for bi-directional, low latency communication, with clients available for Python, JavaScript, Java, iOS, Android, C++, .Net and more. Flask is a lightweight and very popular web framework for Python that makes writing web servers easy and fun, without sacrificing any power. What happens when you combine WebSocket, Socket.IO and Flask? In this talk I'm going to show you some of the cool applications that you can build when these technologies are put to work together, including streaming audio and video, real-time sensor data, automatic voting and more!\n\n#WebSocket #Flask",

        "description": "The Python universe is overflowing with web frameworks, from full featured batteries included frameworks like Django to micro frameworks like Bottle or Flask. They each have their own specific features but in the end they are all very similar in their core functionality of processing requests and generating responses. In this talk I will discuss why I felt the need to create yet another framework, a pico framework, that specifically focuses on the task of building HTTP based APIs for the web. Pico, as it is aptly called, doesn't do templating, ORM, custom routing, authentication, validation, caching, or a million other things. Instead it helps you write clean APIs using simple functions and modules with minimal boilerplate. Pico is both opinionated and flexible in equal measures so you can focus on what matters; your API logic. Pico helps you to write code that that is simple to get started, trivial to test, and easy to maintain as your project grows. APIs built with Pico are self describing so client code can automatically/dynamically be created. Pico includes both a Python & Javascript client but it is also very simple to interact with your API with plain old cURL/Requests/jQuery/etc. It is just a HTTP API after all. \n\nHaving recently released Pico 2.0, this talk will outline the evolution of this framework over the past 7 years and discuss some lessons learnt along the way about building HTTP APIs and frameworks.\n\n#Python #pico",

LMDB was written for the OpenLDAP Project and has proved to be the world’s smallest, fastest, and most reliable transactional embedded data store. It has cemented OpenLDAP’s position as world’s fastest directory server, and its adoption outside the OpenLDAP Project continues to grow, with a wide range of applications including big data services, crypto-currencies, machine learning, and many others.\n\nThe talk will cover highlights of the LMDB design as well as the impact of LMDB on other projects.\n\nNote that LMDB is itself written in C. Wrappers for many other languages exist, such as py-lmdb for Python. The py-lmdb author worked closely with the LMDB developers when creating py-lmdb, but we don't cover py-lmdb in this talk.",

But, since it’s all set up for us automatically when we create our new Django project, sometimes it can be a little mysterious. I’ll clear up some of its mysteries by going over each aspect of authentication in Django and give tips on how to better utilize it for web applications.\nThe authentication package has three main aspects: Users, Groups, and Permissions, along with some authentication middleware to tie it all together.\nFirst I’ll cover Django’s User model, which is the core of the authentication package. I’ll explain how it interacts with the web app, and I’ll even give a few tips on how it can be customized.\nThen I’ll talk about Groups, and how they interact with the User model. I’ll give some tips on how to manage users in web apps based on groups to get the most out of them.\n\nThen I’ll cover permissions, which relate to how users can interact with the web app. I’ll go over some examples for how to use the default permissions, how to set up custom permissions, and how this is particularly used in the Django admin panel.\nFinally, I’ll talk about Django’s authentication middleware, and how users are authenticated throughout the app. I’ll cover examples for how users get sent through requests, and how to handle logic surrounding authentication in Django’s views and templates.\"",

Task Queues will be introduced, Celery will be covered and a specific example of a refactoring of a sequential crawler to highlight the ease and utility of this library. Workflows will then be covered, Airflow will be introduced, in the context of more complex tasks with requirements plus dependencies, building on how tasks as the atomic unit can be woven together to support complex business / app requirements as Workflows. The theme linking both aspects is the need to provide a reliable async fabric (Celery + Rabbitmq) only provides part of a solution for more complex problems, hence the need to use Airflow (with Celery executors) to provide the additional smarts / logic necessary to solve them.",

The protection methods include strong encryption, authentication and authorization, and anonymization. The latter, the data anonymization, removes or modifies sensitive data in an irreversible transformation, preserving sufficient data characteristics to enable analysis, aggregations and evaluation while protecting privacy. In our talk we will discuss using two modules: faker and mimesis, for anonymizing customer data. The primarily goal of both modules is producing synthetic data for development and quality assurance. \n\nHowever, the modules can be used for anonymizing data sets, preserving data characteristics, such as uniqueness and consistency. The data formats of, for example, email addresses, urls, dates, are also preserved",

At its core it is an introduction to some of the concepts of Golang for the Python enthusiast who is willing to see and use the benefits of each. It is not here to change your opinion of Python; it is here to (perhaps) give you a new perspective on software development and show you how diversity is important not just amongst humans but also amongst codebases.",

Another died because of a camera’s inability to distinguish colours from one another, and yet another died because of bad GPS data. Many thousands more deaths could have been prevented by a single variable, if the developers had thought to include it. As software developers, our skills and ideas are increasingly crucial for keeping the world running. We don’t have time to test for, find, and fix all of the bugs. Most bugs are annoying, some bugs allow for sneaky behaviour, but the most innocuous of edge cases can sometimes lead to an actual loss of life. No software ever holds up to contact with reality, but in this talk, Lilly Ryan shows you some of the more extreme consequences of tech debt, and offers guidelines on how your team can more easily identify assumptions and eliminate edge case behaviour when developing software. That boring task hiding in your backlog might just save a life.",

Our tech department has around 1700 people across 3 different countries. Operating in Germany is very interesting from a data protection point of view (specially for products like this) In this talk we present a technical overview of customer intent; a product that assigns a state (exploring, gathering, comparing or deciding) to each customer at any given point in their customer journey in the Zalando shop. We will introduce the problem of customer intent and briefly present our unsupervised approach to solve this model which uses a Hidden Markov Models algorithm. During this talk, we will explain the main challenges we faced on each of the steps when building, and the lessons learned from building this product from an engineering perspective. We will introduce our architecture, the reason behind using PySpark to build our product and how we made extensive use of Apache Zeppelin notebooks and branch-specific deployments in AWS EMR clusters for early experimentation. We will then show how we rewrote parts of the Python HMMLearn library using PySpark to achieve almost linear scalability. Finally, we will explain our use of AWS Data Pipelines to run daily jobs for both feature creation and scoring Zalando customers across 6 different countries, and how we support our product being used by several personalization products in different contexts.",

Practitioners and researchers have recently begun applying them to other general natural language processing applications. The convolution layers in a neural network operate by passing a kernel transformation over adjacent features such as words or pixels. This enables the convolution layer to 'learn' features such as expressions where the meaning of a phrase is dependant upon its context. Stacking multiple convolution layers enables the network to detect higher order features which further processing such as a densely connected feed forward layer can use for purposes such as classification of sentiment,legal context etc..",

        "description": "Globally, research teams are reporting dramatic improvements in text classification accuracy and text processing by employing deep neural networks. But what are deep nets? Can you harness these techniques in your own projects? How much training data do you need? What are the libraries required? Do you need a super computer? Do these techniques improving accuracy and are they worth the hassle? In this talk, we'll examine some basic neural architectures for text classification, we'll run through how to use the Python Keras library for classification, and speak a little about our experience in using these techniques.",

CFFI allows you to call code written in other programming languages without having to write anything other than Python code, it is famous for being able to call C code but is also able to call code written in other languages like Rust and Go. This talk will go over the advantages of using CFFI as opposed to the other ways of calling external libraries in Python (such as writing C extensions) and showcase more advanced ways of using CFFI to improve PyPy's compatibility with Python modules.",

I'll cover some of the core ideas in language design; lexing, parsing, tokenization, with an emphasis on how you can compactly implement these in Python to build your own language. I'll also discuss the features of Lisp (and Áireamhán), and how these functional programming primitives give us a really powerful framework for computation that inspired some of the parts of Python that we all know and love.",

A variety of mathematical tools is available to model simple processes analytically, However, when things get more complicated we need to fall back on to Monte Carlo simulations. \n\n\n\nSimPy is a package that uses generators to model discrete, time-based processes, such as queueing systems, financial markets and network protocols. By simulating a process or scenario a significant number of times, we can inspect possibilities of failure, expected utilization rates, targets aimed for in the healthcare industry and how changes we make in the decisions for our processes impact these performance indicators. In the talk, we use the running example of alien UFO factories, where we assume the role of factory manager and need to make decisions on hiring staff, the equipment that we need in our processing pipeline, the contracts with our customers and the actual location of our new factory. \n\n\n\nSome choices cost less money but are less efficient or introduce higher risks, and dependencies between the different parts of the process make it difficult to oversee the impact of our choices. After showcasing the scenario, we will add these concepts one by one in our SimPy model and link them to discrete event simulation theory. After the implementation, we can gather insights on the risks and the profits and make an informed decision on our factory. This talk is aimed at people interested in Monte Carlo simulation, stochastic optimization, Operations Research, statistics, UFOs or an innovative way of using Python generators.",

These techniques have been driving important improvements in many NLP applications over the past few years, so the interest around word embeddings is spreading. \n\n\n\nIn this talk, we'll discuss the basic linguistic intuitions behind word embeddings, we'll compare some of the most popular word embedding approaches, from word2vec to fastText, and we'll showcase their use with Python libraries. The aim of the talk is to be approachable for beginners, so the theory is kept to a minimum. By attending this talk, you'll be able to learn: \n\n- the core features of word embeddings \n\n- how to choose between different word embedding algorithms \n\n- how to implement word embedding techniques in Python",
