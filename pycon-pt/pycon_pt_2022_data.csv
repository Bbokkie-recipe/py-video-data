As a programmer, I often ask myself: what am I doing?!
That’s a question and an experience shared by other professionals whose craft is also sometimes difficult and technically puzzling - for example, chefs or opera singers.

But while chefs rarely ask “what is cooking?”, and opera singers rarely ask “what is singing?”, programmers are forever raising the question: “what is programming?”

What am doing, as a programmer? What is the nature of my craft?",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gjutf_Af9HQ/sddefault.jpg,0,False,False,public,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjutf_Af9HQ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjutf_Af9HQ

This year, I took over two open-source Python projects that hadn’t been maintained for years. They used deprecated frameworks and old Python versions. Despite the projects being heavily io-driven and calling web-based APIs, they used synchronous methods. A refactor had been started, then never finished. There were branches full of uncommitted code, tests that tested nothing, irrelevant dependencies… you name it!

After making progress with getting the code into shape, I distilled what I learned into clear steps. When you leave this talk, you will know exactly what to do when you want to improve the performance, security and development ease of Python projects you maintain.

We’ll talk about how to fix all of the above and more, including: moving to async programming, adding type validation with Pydantic, overhauling tests, updating without anything exploding, and choosing the right dependencies.

Finally, I’ll give you a take-home checklist for updating an older project so doing this at home can be efficient and pain-free.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CWQLryJ037g/maxresdefault.jpg,0,False,False,public,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWQLryJ037g,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWQLryJ037g
