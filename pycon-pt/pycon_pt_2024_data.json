        "description": "Building custom managers in Django greatly enhances your data retrieval process, abstracting the logic in the manager methods. When the ORM isn't enough you can add raw SQL, but once your queries start to grow, it might be hard to manage user-defined arguments, repeated logic and many other aspects. In this talk, I'll show you how you can use templating engines like Jinja2 to build reusable, extensible and easy to understand raw SQL templates, used by your manager to improve your data retrieval process.\n\nhttps://pretalx.evolutio.pt/pycon-portugal-2024/talk/CWELKT/",
