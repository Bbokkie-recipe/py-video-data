But how to choose a suitable and robust helper? Is this possible at the moment?\n\nDuring this talk, we are going to compare 3 AI code assistants for Python: ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, and Amazon CodeWhisperer.\nThe criteria will be as follows:\n- security: how passwords & SQL queries are being handled\n- code readability: is generated code easy to follow?\n- cut-off date: what is the latest knowledge of assistant (Python version, packages awareness)\n- creativity: given a certain code, how good is the assistant at creating a Streamlit app?\n- code testing: the ability to generate unit tests to code for different scenarios\n- debugging/troubleshooting: the ability to find an error or to handle it\n\nIn addition to comparison, the results of the programmers' AI code assistants usage survey will be shared. By the end of this talk, attendants will have a good understanding of the differences between AI code assistants for Python, and they will be aware of the possible advantages/disadvantages of each mentioned assistant.",

        "description": "TALK: Artificial Intelligence running on the Blockchain by Lucas Roitman\n\nUntil now, dapps have never been able to incorporate machine learning models. Therefore, it is hard for a dapp such as DTube to compete against centralized apps such as YouTube that can offer better content recommendations to their users.\nNow, you can finally upload your machine learning model to the blockchain, to use in dapps, protocols, or cryptocurrencies. This technology will be explained in detail and how anyone can easily deploy a very simple machine learning model to the blockchain.\n\nThe talk addresses the challenge of integrating machine learning models into decentralized applications (dapps). This has historically been a barrier, limiting the competitiveness of dapps against their centralized counterparts. The session will provide insights on how to deploy and leverage ML models on the blockchain, thus empowering dapps to deliver more personalized and advanced services. It aims to facilitate the convergence of AI and blockchain for enhanced application development.\nThe goal is for attendees to leave with a clear understanding of how to deploy machine learning models on blockchain; and to see the potential of blockchain and AI convergence in creating more personalized, secure, and efficient dapps, thus bridging the gap between decentralized and centralized applications. It is also aimed to foster innovation and collaboration in the blockchain space.",

However, a startling statistic emerges amidst the enthusiasm: merely 13% of machine learning models are deployed into production!\n\nIndeed, the artistry of building and deploying these systems supersedes mere scientific methodology as these models dwell within the realm of complexity and are characterized by an inherent reliance on data distribution. Have you ever wondered if these models are trained upon biased data they are destined to produce haywire decisions?\n\nIn this talk, let us delve into the realm of ethicality, fairness, and unbiasedness, culminating in the seamless integration of machine learning models that embrace ethical considerations in their journey towards production using Python!",

Mutable default arguments: When we provide mutable default arguments, some strange things might happen.\n2. Integer Caching: This is how the is operator can behave in weird ways, and sometimes it is not between -5 and 256 that the is operator works.\n3.

        "description": "TALK: Tavern Crawler: a tool to enable fast and easy development of automated API tests by Jorge Miranda\n\nTavern is an open source pytest plugin aimed to write automated integration tests for HTTP and MQTT APIs. Although based in pytest, the tests are specified in the YAML format, which makes support out-of-the-box in major Python IDEs, such as PyCharm or Visual Studio Code, not possible.\n\nTavern Crawler was developed to address the non-existence of a Tavern UI tool. The tool is a Visual Studio Code (VSCode) extension, with an interface loosely based in VSCode’s Test Explorer, so that developers feel immediately familiar working with it. Having such tool eases writing tests, which can become difficult especially when the number of tests and its complexity increases; and also enables quick visual assessment of the state of these.\n\nThis talk will address the following topics:\n1. Brief introduction to Tavern\n2. Issues with large Tavern projects and why an UI is important\n3. Present and explore the Tavern Crawler extension with live examples\n4. Lessons learned and the future of Tavern Crawler",

Its simplicity, extensive libraries, and integration with scientific computing tools make it an ideal language for expressing quantum algorithms and designing quantum circuits. Python's versatility allows researchers to combine quantum computing with machine learning techniques, opening new possibilities for advancements in the field. Furthermore, Python's emphasis on readability and the support of a vibrant community fosters collaboration and knowledge-sharing, propelling the growth and adoption of quantum computing.",

It turns out, less than you would expect! Of course, \"if it ain't broke, don't fix it\" - yet there are some fruits that are just hanging too low for you to ignore.\n\nStarting from I/O, to (almost) zero-copy conversion from pandas to Polars, you will quickly realise how cheap and convenient it is to swap some bits of your pipelines from pandas to Polars. Though pandas' API is incredibly good, you will soon realise how Polars took it to the next level and made it much more powerful, expressive and intuitive.\n\nCome for the speed, stay for the syntax!",

        "description": "TALK: Faster Python with friends by Murilo Cunha\n\nPython's \"speed problem\" is not a new issue, but there are different ways to speed a Python program up. In recent years, Python 3.11 was released and popularized as the \"faster Python\" and Mojo programming language was recently announced, advertised as having \"usability of Python with the performance of C\". Going back further, we see languages such as Cython, Just In Time (JIT) compilers and bindings.\n\nIn this talk, we'll go over the different approaches to increasing the speed of a Python application. We'll briefly explain how they work, compare the performance through a simple use case, and look at the limitations, tooling, trade-offs, and ease of use.",
