To rise to this challenge, the Ecosystem Services Market Consortium (ESMC) recognizes and rewards agricultural producers who implement sustainable water management practices on their fields. However, it is difficult to quantity the impact of spatially-explicit water management practices for thousands of individual agricultural fields across the United States. This is where Python comes in. This presentation will provide an overview of the collaborative effort to develop a Python-based tool capable of quantifying the impacts of water quantity and water quality management practices on agricultural fields. Specifically, we will discuss ESMC’s needs, the general structure and function of the tool, and how we leveraged open-source Python libraries, publicly available geospatial datasets, and scientifically-based hydrological approaches to meet project goals. We will end with lessons learned and tips for PyLadies looking to venture into Python tool development for scientific applications.",

        "description": "Language: English \n\nBig mentoring programs can help new contributors find your project, but if you've ever participated in something like Hacktoberfest or Google Summer of Code, it can be overwhelming to get so many new contributors at once. Even events like the PyCon sprints or hackathons take a surprising amount of preparation.  Let's talk a bit about preparing your documentation, your tests, your tools, and your mentors so you're resilient and ready for a potential flood of new contributors.\n\nI once worked with a women in tech organization that asked me to run a hackathon with about a week of warning, and they were totally taken aback when I said that wasn't enough time -- I'd done hackathons in the past, surely it was a thing I could throw together in time for their conference?\n\nThe best mentoring events take a lot of preparation.  It's very easy to run an event where people feel like they didn't do much, or they didn't understand things, or things didn't work, or where the experienced folk got stuff done and the beginners got stuck and no one noticed.    It takes more preparation to run events where you really manage to onboard people to your project, or at least let them get a real taste of contributing.\n\nI've been running Google Summer of Code for the Python Software Foundation for a decade or so and participated in a lot of hackathons and code sprints.    I love these events, but one of the biggest problems is that you often get a whole lot of contributors showing up at once, more than your mentors can handle in an ideal world.  Sometimes they're very anxious and pushy, especially in cases where there are prizes or money involved.  It's hard.\n\nSo let's talk about how to prepare.  First, documentation: how much do you need?  How do you test it? How can you empower your new contributors to help?\n\nSecond, tests and automation.  Let's talk about linters, test coverage, and tools like pre-commit that might help people get quick feedback even if there's no mentor available.\n\nThird, let's talk about bugs for new users, how to triage your issues list, and help let people self-direct.\n\nFinally, let's talk about mentoring your mentors: how to use a buddy system, how to check in with the mentors, getting post-flood feedback, and keeping your mentors from burning out. I use buddy system for running whole programs and it helped Python-GSoC run smoothly when I had a kid.",

        "description": "Language: English\n\nJoin us for an insightful talk on ensemble learning in machine learning, where we'll explore how combining multiple models can significantly boost predictive performance. We’ll cover the fundamentals, including the difference between weak and strong learners. Then, we'll dive into key techniques: Bagging, which trains models independently in parallel; Boosting, which sequentially strengthens weak models; and Stacking, which merges models to create a more generalized and robust model. Whether you're a data scientist or just curious, this talk will deepen your understanding of these powerful techniques.\n\nIn this talk, we’ll delve into the fascinating world of ensemble learning techniques in Machine learning —a powerful paradigm that combines the strengths of multiple models to enhance overall predictive performance. Here’s what you can expect: 1. Foundations: Understanding Weak and Strong Learners 2. Bagging: An ensemble technique that has multiple base models trained independently and in parallel. 3. Boosting: A technique that sequentially builds a strong model by combining multiple weak models. 4. Stacking: Model fusion of multiple models, building a more generalized yet robust model.\n\nJoin us in this talk, where we’ll demystify these techniques, understand their inner workings, and discover how they elevate predictive performance. Whether you’re a data scientist, machine learning enthusiast, or curious learner, this talk promises insights that go beyond single models!",

Improving the accessibility of visualizations will enable more people to participate and engage with our data analyses.\n\nIn this talk, we will:\n\n- Examine accessibility fundamentals of visual elements such as color contrast, alternative text descriptions, keyboard navigation support, screen reader compatibility, and more\n- Incorporate these into our data visualizations with practical tips and specific example for common plots\n- Understand the accessibility limitations of widely used Python data visualization tools and libraries, and outline ways to improve them\n\nThis talk is inspired by the accessibility audit and improvements we’re working in the [Bokeh visualization library](https://bokeh.org/), a tool to create interactive visualizations in web browsers. The talk will include learnings from on ongoing work. \n\nWe hope this talk enables you to make your next data visualization, and your visualization tools, more accessible.",

ASTs are a fundamental part of compilers and interpreters, making them essential for language processing, code analysis, and transformation. We’ll explore how ASTx can be applied to different programming languages and showcase examples, including a Fibonacci function. Whether you're developing your own language or creating custom code analysis tools, ASTx provides an intuitive and powerful interface to help you work with ASTs efficiently.\n\nThe ASTx project, a component of the ArxLang ecosystem, serves as an agnostic Python framework for constructing and representing Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs). Its primary objective is to provide a versatile and language-independent structure for ASTs, primarily catering to the needs of the ArxLang project but with the flexibility to be utilized across various programming languages and parsing tools. \nASTx supports various data types such as integer, float and boolean, as well as features like control flow elements and operators. When it comes to visualization, ASTx supports Graphviz and console-based visualization. Both are very helpful for graphical interpretation and debugging, but the ascii-based console visualization has added versatility for use during a pdb session, for example.With all these features, ASTx is a intuitive and powerful interface that can be used to create custom code analysis tools or develop your own language.",

        "description": "Language: English\n\nIn today's digital era, policy discussions within communities are becoming increasingly frequent, raising the question of how to effectively analyze and apply these discussions to support decision-making. This sharing proposes a simple and sustainable text analysis framework based on Python, designed to help community members and policymakers extract valuable insights from discussion data. The proposed framework integrates text mining techniques and sentiment analysis, and dynamic dashboards, utilizing methods such as topic modeling and text similarity calculations to automatically identify key topics, sentiment trends, and similar suggestions within discussions.\n\nWhile still in development, this project emphasizes the sustainability of the approach. Leveraging Python's open-source tools and libraries, I hope to provide a modular analysis process that allows users of varying technical backgrounds to quickly adopt and apply it flexibly to various community policy discussion contexts, and help enable community members to engage more effectively and influence policy decisions.\n\nAs this project is in its early stages, ongoing efforts focus on refining the methodology and validating its applicability in real-world scenarios. The potential applications combine policy analysis with data science methodologies.\n\nIn Taiwan, every summer, government agencies designate a major theme and invite young people to form teams and propose deliberative democracy discussion activities. Each year, there are over 30 such discussions. For each session, reading materials are prepared on the topic, and a final conclusion report is presented. How can these be utilized in policy-making? How can qualitative discussions be quantified to enhance the effectiveness of discussion results? Python offers numerous open-source packages and tools that are well-suited for civic tech applications, improving the quality of civic discussions and policy decisions.\n\nPyLadies is a community where we experience support and empowerment. I hope to extend Python's reach and our community's resilience through this platform, empowering more citizens and issue advocates.",

Even if you plan out a matrix of edge cases, you may still struggle to work your way through each case. These are some of the limitations with example-based testing.\n\nThis talk will describe an approach called property-based testing and walk through a code example with a sort function. It will show how to validate your program’s behavior to more closely match the software specifications, and avoid having a program that happens to pass or fail just a few fixed examples. It will show how to leverage generators to achieve this at scale.\n\nAfter watching this talk, you’ll be able to apply property-based testing to achieve more robust code and a new level of efficiency in your software development.",

        "description": "Language: English\n\nIn the rapidly evolving field of natural language processing, the evaluation of large language models (LLMs) is crucial for understanding their performance and guiding their development. This talk delves into the two primary evaluation methodologies: reference-based and referenceless techniques.\n\nReference-based evaluation relies on predefined ground truth references to assess the quality of generated text. Metrics such as BLEU, ROUGE, and METEOR are commonly used to compare the generated output against these references, providing insights into the model’s accuracy and fluency. However, these metrics often fall short in capturing the nuances of human language and creativity.\n\nOn the other hand, referenceless evaluation techniques, such as BERTScore, perplexity, and human judgment, offer a complementary perspective by assessing the coherence, relevance, and overall quality of the generated text without relying on reference texts. These methods can better capture the subtleties of language generation and provide a more holistic view of model performance.\n\nThis talk will explore the strengths and limitations of both evaluation approaches, highlighting recent advancements and practical applications. This talk is suitable for anyone who has basic understanding of NLP and LLMs and want to know more about evaluation stratergies",

The canonical 'wat' talk (https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat) shows some of these for Ruby and JavaScript, but doesn’t go into any detail into the ‘why’\r\n\r\nIn this talk, take a tour of a dozen different programming languages, from JavaScript to PowerShell, Python to Perl, Elixir and more; and see not only the ‘wat’, but the ‘why’: is it a misunderstanding based on assumption from another programming language? A compiler optimisation? A design consideration? A known bug that can’t be fixed due to backwards compatibility concerns?\r\n\r\nAttendees will come away from this talk with a greater understanding about how to turn a ‘wat’ into a ‘why’.",

Our talk aims to enlighten people about the history of programming while simultaneously discussing the progress and participation of women in coding. Along with facts, this talk will not only help in supporting and motivating the aspiring women in coding but also shed light on the challenges that women have faced in the past. We are familiar with names like Alan Turing and Robert Kahn, but this talk will discuss the exceptional works of Dr. Grace Hopper, who wrote the first computer compiler and Ada Lovelace, who is considered to be the first computer programmer while having an IQ of 160, matching that of Einstein. Women are underrepresented in tech while also being underpaid. Despite the fact that only 28% of women are in tech, during World War II, women operated some of the first computational machines used for code-breaking. There has been a rise and fall and rise of women in programming and conferences like Pyladies, support and encourage women coding in python. Due to such conferences, there has been slow incremental progress. Django Girls is a workshop where women are incentivized to participate due to their cupcakes and free pizza! Women have the amazing ability to be creative while also being able to adapt their solutions according to the challenges they face. There are so many success stories, where learning coding especially in Python as it is fairly easy, has helped people survive, change their career path totally. This talk will hopefully motivate women who are apprehensive about learning coding. This will also discuss some of my personal experiences as a woman in Computer Science.",

        "description": "Language: English\n\nInfectious diseases are the third leading cause of death worldwide, claiming more than 13 million lives every year. While there are many interventions available for managing epidemics – including vaccines, tests and treatments – the best approach is not always clear. There are complex dynamics at play, with many interacting variables, and the optimal response may vary significantly depending on outbreak severity, funding available, and even sociopolitical context. \n\nComputational modelling is a highly effective way to examine the potential impact of different public health interventions. However, the technical difficulty of building fit-for-purpose models that can simulate these impacts and produce quantitative optimisations is a barrier to widespread use.\n\nAtomica is a Python-based simulation engine for compartmental modelling. It provides an easy-to-use yet highly configurable way to build disease models, with built-in support for interventions and optimisation with budget constraints. By leveraging population, transmission, and public health intervention data, as well as conceptual knowledge of how people progress through stages of disease, we can forecast the potential consequences of different public health strategies in specific countries or settings. With this insight, we can help governments to make the best possible decisions on what to prioritise, saving lives in the process. \n\nWhether you’re a beginner or an expert Pythonista, this talk will equip you with the tools to simulate a real-world epidemic and optimise funding distribution for maximum impact.",

        "description": "Language: English\n\nTeaching people to code is...tricky. \n\nSoftware development and teaching are two distinct skill sets, yet people with technical skills are often put into a position where they are meant to teach others, this might be through workplace mentorship, community involvement, or through being hired to teach (for example, in a bootcamp). They are often expected to succeed with very little or no teacher training at all. A lot of common practice is very ineffective.\n\nMany think that when it comes to teaching, you either have it or you don't. I'm happy to inform you that those people are mistaken.\n\nTeaching and learning is something that has been well studied. There are techniques, patterns, and anti-patterns. There are skills that can be learned and practiced.\n\nI've been working in alternative education for a number of years, and the people who graduate from the courses I've put together tend to do really well for themselves. \n\nIn this talk, I'd like to share a few of the things I've learned over the years. We'll cover studies, mindsets, mechanisms, patterns, and anti-patterns.  The Python community is full of people with teacher's hearts. My goal is to amplify their efforts.",

We'll begin with a brief introduction to the Array API standard and its benefits, focusing on its impact on cross-library functions and model training speed. Next, we'll examine a detailed example of a scikit-learn kernel that shows significant performance improvements due to the Array API. Currently in scikit-learn, users can choose to use Array API by enabling or disabling a flag called \"array_api_dispatch.\" We'll demonstrate how to turn on this flag during the tutorial and showcase the resulting performance changes. By the end of this talk, attendees will have a high-level understanding of the Array API standard and know how to use it in their own scikit-learn projects.\n\nThe talk will begin with a personal introduction, detailing my background, current role, and involvement with scikit-learn. I'll then provide a brief overview of the Array API standard and direct attendees to the official page for more information. Next, I'll explain the benefits of adopting the Array API standard, including GPU utilization with Torch or CuPy (as opposed to just NumPy), JIT compiler advantages, and distributed computing capabilities with DASK. However, I'll note that scikit-learn is currently focused primarily on GPU utilization.\n\nThe core of this presentation will be a code example demonstrating the significant increase in processing speed when enabling the array_api_dispatch flag. I'll start by showing and explaining an estimator that supports Array API. Then, I'll train a model using this estimator without the array_api_dispatch flag (CPU training), using time.perf_counter to measure the fitting duration. Following this, I'll enable the flag and retrain the model (GPU training), again tracking the time. We'll compare the training times with and without the flag enabled, highlighting the substantial speed improvement with array_api_dispatch turned on.\n\nTo conclude, I'll showcase a meta issue in the scikit-learn GitHub repository that tracks Array API-related issues, providing attendees with a resource for further exploration and potential contribution.",

        "description": "Language: Spanish\n\nLos **datos satelitales** son un instrumento fundamental para el análisis de fenómenos climáticos como incendios forestales, sequías e inundaciones. Hoy en día, agencias espaciales como la NASA ponen a disposición sus datos de manera **abierta**. Esto permite que cualquier persona pueda trabajar con esos datos y analizar su región de interés.\nEn esta charla presentaremos, de manera breve, un **flujo de trabajo reproducible** donde, partiendo de una región de interés y utilizando datos abiertos de la plataforma *Earth Data Cloud* de la NASA, junto con el potencial de Jupyter Notebook y Python, obtendremos un mapa de la **extensión del área afectada**. Esta presentación forma parte de un taller (hands-on) gratuito de 3 horas que las organizaciones  2i2c y MetaDocencia se encuentran desarrollando en el contexto de materiales educacionales abiertos.\n\nLa gestión de fenómenos climáticos, como incendios forestales, sequías e inundaciones, representan un desafío a nivel mundial. Estos fenómenos naturales están intrínsecamente vinculados a las distribuciones dinámicas de aguas superficiales, las precipitaciones, la vegetación y el uso de la tierra. Estas distribuciones se pueden modelar para pronósticos y análisis utilizando cientos de petabytes de datos satelitales disponibles a través de la plataforma *Earth Data Cloud* de la NASA.\nEn esta charla expondremos el flujo de trabajo realizado para **analizar la extensión de un incendio** producido en el año 2023. Para ello veremos como extraer la información del *Earth Data Cloud* (específicamente, se trabajará con productos *OPERA Disturbance*) y, a partir de esa información, como crear un mapa que indique el área afectada.\nLos fenómenos climáticos son comunes en todo el mundo, pero al mismo tiempo son difíciles de analizar y evaluar de manera regionalmente apropiada y adecuada para personas que no son expertas en el campo de teledetección. El objetivo de esta charla es presentar un flujo de trabajo basado en Jupyer/Python, ​​en la nube y utilizando los datos de teledetección que sirva como **motivación para ser aplicados a otras regiones o contextos por personas no expertas**. El ejemplo que mostraremos muestra cómo desarrollar un análisis basado en datos satelitales utilizando herramientas y datos relevantes y cómo se puede hacer desde la perspectiva de ciencia abierta. Para ello, utilizaremos bibliotecas científicas de Python (por ejemplo, Rasterio, Xarray, etc.) centrándonos en el procesamiento y la visualización de datos de forma reproducible y transparente.\nEsta presentación está basada en un tutorial, desarrollado conjuntamente por MetaDocencia y 2i2c, que es parte de las iniciativas de Ciencia Abierta y Transformación a Ciencia Abierta (TOPS) de la NASA. Un objetivo importante es reforzar los principios de reproducibilidad y flujos de trabajo abiertos basados ​​en la ciencia.",

        "description": "Language : English\n\nIn an increasingly connected world, ensuring accessibility for all is essential. This talk explores the potential for automatic tools that bridge the communication gap for Deaf and hard-of-hearing people through the use of sign language. We will delve into the current challenges and advancements in developing AI-powered systems capable of understanding, translating, and generating sign language in real time. By examining the intersection of machine learning, computer vision, and linguistics, we aim to address the pivotal question: Can technology truly enhance accessibility without compromising the richness and complexity of sign languages? Join us as we explore the future of communication and inclusion through innovative solutions designed to empower those relying on sign language.\n\nThis talk explores the progress and limitations of automatic sign language. I see more and more tools being created without involving the community. I'd like to raise awareness among people who create inclusive tools of the importance of involving the people concerned. Before creating a tool, ask yourself whether it's useful or not and contact the people concerned to see whether it's worthwhile.\nAs deaf myself and French, I see so many tools that focus on sign language that are useless apart from the wow factor.",

        "description": "Language: English \n\nData analytics still isn’t always done in a dedicated analytics database. The business wants to glean insights and value from the data that’s generated over time by your OLTP applications, and the simplest way to do that is often just to run analytics queries directly on your application database.\n\nOf course, this almost certainly involves running complex queries, joining data from multiple tables, and working on large data sets. If your database and code are optimised for performance of your day-to-day application activity, you’re likely to slow down your application and find yourself with analytics queries that take far too long to run.\n\nLet’s have a look at some of the techniques you can use to optimise your database for an analytics workload without compromising the performance of your application.\n\nIn this talk, we'll discuss the challenges associated with running data analytics on an existing application database. We'll look at some of the impacts this type of workload could have on the application, and why it could cause the analytics queries themselves to perform poorly. \n\nWe'll then look at a number of different strategies, tools and techniques that can prevent the two workloads from impacting each other. We will look at things such as architecture choices, configuration parameters, materialized views and external tools. \n\nThe focus will be on PostgreSQL, but most of the concepts are relevant to other database systems.",
